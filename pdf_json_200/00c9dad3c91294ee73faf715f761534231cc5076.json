            "text": "Infrastructure as Code is a new approach to computing infrastructure management that allows users to leverage tools such as version control, automatic deployments, and program analysis for infrastructure configurations. This approach allows for faster and more homogeneous configuration of a complete infrastructure. Infrastructure as Code languages, such as CloudFormation or TerraForm, use a declarative model so that users only need to describe the desired state of the infrastructure. However, in practice, these languages are not processed atomically. During an upgrade, the infrastructure goes through a series of intermediate states. We identify a security vulnerability that occurs during an upgrade even when the initial and final states of the infrastructure are secure, and we show that those vulnerability are possible in Amazon's AWS and Google Cloud. We call such attacks intra-update sniping vulnerabilities. In order to mitigate this shortcoming, we present a technique that detects such vulnerabilities and pinpoints the root causes of insecure deployment migrations. We implement this technique in a tool, H\u00e4yh\u00e4, that uses dataflow graph analysis. We evaluate our tool on a set of open-source CloudFormation templates and find that it is scalable and could be used as part of a deployment workflow.",

A relatively new approach to infrastructure management is called Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This has given rise to many different tools with a shared goal: helping system administrators manage their infrastructure in the same way as they manage code. Some tools, like Ansible [20] , Puppet [23] or Chef [6] are Configuration Management tools: they allow the administrator to specify the entire configuration of one or more running machines and automatically deploy it by connecting to that machine and performing administrative tasks on behalf of the administrator. These tools automatically detect and apply the steps necessary to switch from the current state of a machine to the desired state, specified by the administrator. Similarly, tools like Amazon's CloudFormation [3] or Hashicorp's Terraform [11] read a description of the desired infrastructure and automatically take the necessary Fig. 1 : A deployment of a computation (the orange lambda), accessing a database (the blue disk stack), which is accessible to the outside world through an API (the purple gateway). The upgrade should change the computation to access more sensitive data (the lambda with the subscript 2), but be authenticated through a user check (the red identification checks). steps to deploy that infrastructure. In CloudFormation, an infrastructure configuration is declared as a set of resources.",

We argue that this parallelism, as well as the global naming used in these infrastructures, can lead to discrepancies during the upgrade that lead to a violation of the intended security policy, even if the initial infrastructure and the target infrastructure are both perfectly secure. We empirically validate our claims by reenacting this vulnerability in both, Amazon's AWS and in Google Cloud.",

Consider an example given in Figure 1 : an API service that replies to any request with some benign information, as depicted in Fig. 1a . The service is upgraded so that the API returns private information about users, and the security policy is modified to allow only authenticated users to access the service, as shown in Figure 1d . This architecture is a core architectural building block for serverless computing. This same configuration is recommended in AWS's \"Well Architected\" developer guideline series [1] . The upgrade code is functionally correct and implements the desired change, but the user did not specify ordering constraints. However, without such constraints, there are two possible upgrade plans. First, as shown in Figure 1b , the backend computation may be updated first. In this case, since the authentication has not yet been added to the API, there is a short period of time where private data is publicly accessible. The amount of time this information is exposed depends on the cloud service provider and the particulars of the infrastructure, but typically ranges on the order of seconds to minutes. We call this kind of attack intra-update sniping vulnerability. The second possible upgrade order, shown in Figure 1c , implements the desired secure update order. Enforcing the second ordering requires the user to explicitly specify an ordering constraint that the authentication must be added before the backend computation is updated.",

If no dependency is specified, the lambda could be created and connected to the bucket before CloudFormation recognizes that the bucket is already owned. The attacker who owns this bucket may then inject their data into the user's system during the time it takes CloudFormation to notice the naming conflict and roll back the migration.

On the opposite side of this trade-off, some practitioners advocate for Immutable Infrastructure [12] management, which re-builds the entire infrastructures from scratch on each update and only switches atomically to the new infrastructure when it is ready. This practice would guarantee atomicity of updates to the infrastructure and the absence of intra-update sniping vulnerabilities.

This representation is a dataflow graph identifying which component of the infrastructure has access to which other components, and under which security assumptions. Figure 2 shows two such simplified dataflow graphs that our tool built from arch in Fig. 1 . From this graph, H\u00e4yh\u00e4 learns the desired security level of each component. In this section we describe how to compute security levels of resources in a given CloudFormation file: in Section 2.1 we describe the concrete syntax of a general CloudFormation file and how it applies Step 2: Capturing all potential upgrade states. After the initial and target configurations are converted to our model, H\u00e4yh\u00e4 builds an upgrade state, designed to represent every possible intermediate infrastructure that could exist during the upgrade. In Section 2.4 we formally define the upgrade semantics from an initial state to a target state in terms of our model, while in Section 3.1 we show how the upgrade state is built in practice. Figure 3 shows such a state, in form of a graph, which contains a path (Web to PublicGet to PrivateLambda) allowing any user on the web to access a sensitive resource in a non-secure manner. Finally, in Section 3.2 we discuss how dependency relations refine the upgrade state. Step 3: Analysis. (Section 3.3) H\u00e4yh\u00e4 computes an over-approximation of the intermediate states and the security level of their nodes in order to answer two questions: 1) is every node in every possible intermediate state at least as secure as the corresponding node in the initial or target configuration? and 2) does every node in every possible intermediate state communicate only with existing nodes? Any possible violation is reported to the user so they can take action and modify their target configuration accordingly. For example, using the DependsOn keyword, one can enforce build orders in a CloudFormation file. For Figure 3 , H\u00e4yh\u00e4 reports the possible insecure access to PrivateLambda:",

Second, the result of such tools would not be easy to understand for end users, as they would report issues with states that are not defined or even considered by the user. Our goal is a tool that is both scalable and able to provide suggestions on how to change the target configuration, not some hidden intermediate configuration. To address scalability we introduce upgrade states which represent multiple states on which we can apply the same execution semantics. Recall that a state is composed of a list of resources with their origin, type and references, and of a dependency relation. An upgrade state is composed in the same way. The set of resources is the union of the resources from the initial and target states, excluding initial resources that only differ from their target counterpart by their provenance flag.

To do this, we collected 36 CloudFormation files from GitHub, where each file had a history of updates (commits).

We found that our analysis completed within one seconds for all files -we believe that these results indicate that H\u00e4yh\u00e4 could be integrated in developer workflow with minimal disruption to the user. The details of the evaluation dataset are given in Fig. 6 . To collect the set of GitHub CloudFormation files used in our scalability benchmark, we searched GitHub using the web search tool for code with the keyword AWSTemplateFormatVersion -which is a required keyword for any Cloud-Formation file. We then filtered by the .yaml extension, and further manually filtered for valid CloudFormation files (as opposed to other languages with overlap).

Additionally, despite existing recommendations and good practices when dealing with cloud infrastructure, many existing deployments are still left insecure by user misconfigurations. For example, storage \"buckets\" which host files, should generally be configured by user to disallow world readable/writable permissions. However, in practice, users struggle with this [8] .
