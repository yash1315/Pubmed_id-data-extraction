This study aimed to quantify demographic, occupational, and community risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers in a large metropolitan healthcare system. Methods: We analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey conducted from April through June of 2020 linking risk factors for occupational and community exposure to COVID-19 with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. A multivariable logistic regression model was fit to quantify risk factors for infection. Participants were employees and medical staff members who elected to participate in SARS-CoV-2 serology testing offered to all healthcare workers as part of a quality initiative, and who completed a survey on exposure to COVID-19 and use of personal protective equipment. Exposures of interest included known demographic risk factors for COVID-19, residential zip code incidence of COVID-19, occupational exposure to PCR test-positive healthcare workers or patients, and use of personal protective equipment. The primary outcome of interest was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Results: SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was estimated to be 5.7% (95% CI: 5.2%-6.1%) among 10,275 healthcare workers. Community contact with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19 (aOR=1.9, 95% CI:1.4-2.5) and zip code level COVID-19 incidence (aOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-2.0) increased the odds of infection. Black individuals were at high risk (aOR=2.0, 95% CI:1.6-2.4). Overall, occupational risk factors accounted for 27% (95% CI: 25%-30%) of the risk among healthcare workers and included contact with a PCR testpositive healthcare worker (aOR=1.2, 95% CI:1.0-1.6). Conclusions: Community risk factors, including contact with a COVID-19 positive individual and residential COVID-19 incidence, are more strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers than exposure in the workplace.",

            "text": "Healthcare workers (HCWs) are presumed to be at high risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through occupational exposure to infected patients or coworkers. Studies have reported a wide range of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, among HCWs. This variation has in part been attributed to differential risk of exposure related to COVID-19 incidence in the community. 1 Indeed, recent studies have shown that a substantial number of infections among HCWs could not be traced to occupational exposures 2 and that community exposures were as or more strongly associated with infection. 3 While previous studies have compared seroprevalence in HCWs with that of the general population, few have rigorously considered workplace risk factors alongside community risk factors among HCWs to estimate their relative contribution to overall infection risk. 4, 5 Accounting for the role of community risk, which may be large, is especially important because reports of occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs have been inconsistent. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] While some studies have shown weak associations between involvement in clinical care, care of COVID-19 patients, and exposure to coworkers with COVID-19, [6] [7] [8] others have shown that these are, in fact, risk factors for infection. 4, 5 Moreover, previous studies have not accounted for potential participation bias, though have cited it as a major limitation. 1, 2, 4, 7 Adjusting for participation bias while considering both workplace and community risk factors for infection can bring us closer to an accurate understanding of which workplace exposures confer the highest risk of infection for HCWs. This information can inform strategies to protect HCWs as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.",

At the time of testing, HCWs completed a survey describing use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and possible exposure to COVID-19 inside and outside the workplace. These data were combined with employee demographic data. To assess community exposure to COVID-19, we used data from the Georgia Department of Public Health to calculate COVID-19 cumulative incidence by zip code and week. As a measure of exposure in their community, we assigned each participant the COVID-19 cumulative incidence in their zip code of residence two weeks prior to their test date to account for the lag from the time of infection to seroconversion (eFigure 1 in Supplement). The serologic test used to analyze participant samples was developed at the Emory Medical Laboratory and measures IgG antibody to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. 9 We fit a logistic regression model to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) between potential risk factors and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Model predictors (eTable 1 in Supplement) included demographics (age group; race; ethnicity), community exposure (cumulative incidence of COVID-19 by residential zip code two weeks before testing date; contact with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases outside the workplace), and occupational factors (workplace role and location; contact with COVID-positive patients and staff; use of PPE). Workplace location was self-reported and described the location(s) where a HCW spent the most time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since over one-third (36.4%) of HCWs reported spending equal time in more than one location, the workplace location variable was structured as a hierarchy. We ranked locations based on the anticipated risk of encounters with COVID-19 positive patients (see eTable 1 in Supplement for details) with high encounter risk locations, such as the emergency department and COVID-19 focused units, highest and no patient contact and working from home ranked lowest. HCWs were categorized into the highest-ranking location where they reported working.",

This rate is similar to the overall 6.0% seroprevalence reported from 13 U.S. academic medical centers and is generally consistent with other estimates among HCWs in the early stages of the pandemic. 1, 2, 7, 11 The percent of seropositive HCWs who reported no past COVID-19-like illness was also similar to past estimates of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. 1 We found that community and demographic factors--contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-positive case, Black race, and age under 30 years--were more important predictors of seropositivity than occupational factors. Notably, racial disparities, now well-documented in the general population, 12-14 persist in HCWs 1,15 after accounting for other risk factors, underscoring the fundamental racial inequities that have become the hallmark of the COVID-19 pandemic. We partially adjusted for community risk by including zip code-level COVID-19 incidence in our model, but we are unable to account for more proximal factors likely to have contributed to higher risk of infection among Black HCWs, including higher likelihood of exposure at home or use of public transportation. Ultimately, these risk factors are tied to entrenched, systemic social processes that underlie many individual and population health disparities. 16, 17 We found few strong risk factors for infection in the workplace. Those who reported caring for patients with COVID-19 infection and those working in procedure areas where aerosol generating procedures are routine were not more likely to be seropositive, supporting the efficacy of PPE practices for known COVID-19 patients. Working in clinical areas was associated with increased odds of seropositivity, although the aORs were imprecise. We were not able to determine if risk associated with workplace location was from patient exposure, including unsuspected COVID-19 infected patients or from co-workers. Risk from contact with HCWs later found to be COVID-19positive could reflect transmission during pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infection prior to universal use of masks or transmission in settings where masks were not worn. In our hospital system, contact tracing identified staff eating together in break rooms as a risk factor for transmission.",

This adjustment at least partially accounts for poor representation of Black HCWs, in whom seroprevalence was higher than the population average, among those who volunteered for testing. However, other factors related to infection risk may have influenced participation. Second, a test with imperfect specificity in a population where seroprevalence is low will likely result in some false positives which may bias aORs towards the null. Third, we could not account for rapidly evolving infection prevention practices early in the pandemic and social behavior inside or outside the workplace. Lastly, the large influx of COVID-19 patients caused major shifts in care delivery and personnel deployment. Many HCWs worked in multiple locations and even different roles.",
