In this study, we showed that the DBS based approach used is an insensitive approach 196 relative to assays on venous plasma, with the limit of detection of the assay estimated to be 197 about 30 times lower with DBS samples. This is not unexpected, because the DBS eluate is 198 at best 10% plasma. In reality, elution will be incomplete, and (as we showed) smaller spots 199 result in lower concentrations of antibody. Nevertheless, in the small sample tested, the 200 sensitivity of DBS at our experimental cut-off relative to the reference test was 89%, with 201 wide confidence intervals due to the small study size. This is compatible with an 202 observation, in a much larger independent cohort of 595 seropositive individuals, that about 203 10% of the population studied have antibody concentrations which we estimate would not be 204 detectable by DBS. 205 This study has several important limitations. Firstly, DBS has only been tested on a 206 relatively small sample set, only 18 of which were positive on the reference standard, and 207 none of whom had a previous positive PCR test. Secondly, sensitivity and specificity 208 estimates of the index test were based on cut-offs derived from the data, and so should be 209 considered exploratory. Thirdly, the sensitivity of the test depends on the distribution of 210 antibody concentrations in the target population; here, we only studied one population of key 211 workers. If other cohorts are studied in which antibody concentrations have declined 212 compared with the one we studied, DBS will perform worse than we observe here. Fourthly, 213 we assessed samples taken by trained phlebotomist. Variation in performance was 214 observed between phlebotomists (and presumably would also occur between self-taken 215 samples); as such, usability studies to quantify the extent of this variation would be essential 216 to understand how the tests perform when self-administered by the target population. 217",
