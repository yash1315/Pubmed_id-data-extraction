            "text": "Background: Based on the reports of low prevalence and severity of pediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, the Korean government has released new SARS-CoV-2 infection response and treatment guidelines for children under the age of 12 years. The government has further directed school reopening under strict preventive measures. However, there is still considerable concern on the impact of school reopening on community transmission of Coronavirus disease 2019 . In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the appropriateness of these directives and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children as compared to adults using sufficient national sample data. Methods: In the present study, we evaluated the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pediatric patients as compared to adults by analyzing the length of hospital stays (LOS), medical expenses, and hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates. A multivariate linear regression analysis was carried out to examine the effects of COVID-19 patients that the characteristics on the LOS and medical expenses, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to identify COVID-19 characteristics that affect hospital and ICU admission rates and to prove the low SARS-CoV-2 infection severity in pediatric patients. Results: The hospitalization period for children aged 0-9 was 37% shorter and that of patients aged 10-19 years was 31% shorter than those of older age groups (P < 0.001). The analysis of the medical expenses by age showed that on average, medical expenses for children were approximately 4,900 USD lower for children than for patients over 80 years of age. The linear regression analysis also showed that patients who were 0-9 years old spent 87% and those aged 10-19 118% less on medical expenses than those aged 70 and over, even after the correction of other variables (P < 0.001). The probability of hospitalization was the lowest at 10-19 years old (odds ratio [OR], 0.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.09), and their ICU admission rate was also the lowest at 0.14 (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08-0.24). On the other hand, the likelihood of hospitalization and ICU admission was the highest in children aged 0-9 years, and among patients under the age of 50 years in general. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the low severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in younger patients (0-19 years) by analyzing the LOS, medical expenses, hospital, and intensive care unit admission rates as outcome variables. As the possibility to develop severe infection of coronavirus at the age of 10-19 was the lowest, a mitigation policy is also required for middle and high school students. In addition, children with underlying diseases need to be protected from high-risk infection environments.",

            "text": "It is now more than one year since the first case of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was reported in the Republic of Korea, and as of February 1, 2021, there were 85,567 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Among the cases, 9,063 cases (10%) are children below 19 years, 1 and no child fatality has been reported so far. This is similar to a global trend; many clinical studies have reported a low risk of infection and mild COVID-19 symptoms in children as compared to adults. According to a clinical analysis of 2,135 COVID-19 pediatric patients reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most children infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from January 16 to February 8 in China showed mild or no symptoms. Of the 728 confirmed COVID-19 pediatric patients, 408 had mild or no symptoms, 298 cases were moderate, and only 18 cases were severe. 2 In addition, in another study that included 31 COVID-19 pediatric patients in China, 17 cases were asymptomatic or mild, and 14 children had symptoms of pneumonia. There were no severe cases, and their symptoms usually improved within 3 days. 3 Together, these findings indicate that children's clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 may be less severe than that of adults.",

            "text": "A study by the CDC in the United States on SARS-CoV-2 in children reported that, as of April 2, 2020, out of 149,082 COVID-19 patients, 2,572 (22%) were children (< 18 years). Of the confirmed cases, 147 were hospitalized and only 15 children were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Most cases of hospitalization were children < 1 year or with underlying diseases. 75% of the children had symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, but they reported mild clinical manifestation. 4 A study in Korea reported milder illness in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. The study included 91 COVID-19 confirmed pediatric patients aged under 19 years in Korea from February 18 to March 31, 2020. 30% of the patients had a mild fever and 39% of the patients had a high fever (38\u00b0C or higher). More than 60% of the patients had respiratory symptoms, and there were cases of anosmia and ageusia. Some patients had abdominal pain and diarrhea. In general, of the 91 patients, 65 tested positive for an RT-PCR test, among the 85% had mild symptoms, and no case developed to a severity level that required intensive care. This study showed that pediatric infections are less symptomatic and severe with a possibility of living a normal life unaware of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 5 Based on the reports of low prevalence and severity of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections, the government has released new SARS-CoV-2 infection response and treatment guidelines for children. Following these guidelines, pediatric patients with no or mild symptoms can be treated at home under the care of their parents. 6 This measure is meant to provide psychological stability along with treatment. In addition, some studies demonstrated that schools are not high-risk infection environments 7, 8 and that transmission to children was mostly household, with a low percentage of school transmissions (2.4%). 9 Together, these findings could have inspired the Korean government to direct school reopening under strict infection prevention guidelines. 10 However, there is still considerable concern on the impact of school reopening on community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",

The medical expense analysis by age showed that the average medical expense for children was approximately 4,900 USD lower than that of patients aged over 80 years. The linear regression analysis also showed that children 0-9 years of age spent 87%, and those aged 10-19 spent 118% less on medical expenses than those aged 70 years and above, even after correction of other variables. The probability of hospitalization was the lowest at 10-19 years old (67.2%), which was 95% lower compared to patients aged 70 years or older, and also, their ICU admission rate was the lowest at 6.3%.

The average cost of medical expenses for patients aged 0-34, including children, was the lowest (2,752 USD), while the average cost for those aged 70 and above was approximately five times higher than that of the younger age group (11, 668 USD) . This study assumed that most of the older people already had an underlying disease, and the presence of diseases may have influenced the high medical expenses. 14 However, in our study, even after correcting for severe underlying diseases through CCI score, the medical expense for the elderly was still high. This could be attributed to age-related immune system changes, which may be relevant not only to the agerelated illnesses but also susceptibility to infectious diseases. 15 Our results also showed that the higher the age, the higher the probability of admission, and patients aged 10-19 years had the lowest admission rates. According to the recent study on the Financial Burden of Hospitalization of Children with COVID-19 in Korea, medical cost increased with age, but similar to our results, it was measured lower in children aged 11-15 years compared to 6-10 years. In addition, in terms of medication use, it was also less prescribed in patients aged 11-15 years. These results suggest that the severity of coronavirus is low in the teenage group. 16 In another study that evaluated the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients admitted in hospital and ICU in the United States, Hospital and ICU admissions rates also showed a trend of increasing with age, but the hospital admission rate for patients aged 0-19, was 2.5%, this was the lowest compared to other age groups, and there were no ICU admission cases. 17 Overall, the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients under the age of 19 years was lower than in adults, and among the younger patients, in particular, 0-9 years old are more likely to develop serious symptoms than those aged 10-19 years. Similar to our findings, some studies already in China showed that infants can develop severe illness when infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Researchers analyzed the confirmed and suspected COVID-19 pediatric patients aged 0-15 years reported from January 16 to February 8, 2020. They revealed that the proportion of COVID-19 patients with severe and critical illness among infants was highest in patients < 1 year (10.7%), 7.3% in 1-5 years, and 4.2% for the patients aged 6-10 years. Based on our results, the lower the age, the higher the probability of poor prognosis. 2 In addition, a cohort study of 25 confirmed COVID-19 pediatric patients in Hubei, China, showed that two severely ill patients were infants under the age of 1 year who had symptoms of secondary bacterial pneumonia. This study conjectured that bacterial pneumonia, which is prevalent in infancy, may be the cause of the poor prognosis. 18 Currently, in Korea, self-treatment measures have been proposed for pediatric patients with a low risk of complications among children aged 0-12 years, and from March 2021, children under the age of 8 years will be attending school every day under COVID-19 response measures. However, based on this and previous studies, the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection was lowest at the age of 10-19 years, the age for children who are less likely to develop more severe symptoms should be adjusted in the mitigation measures.",

These results showed a pattern similar to studies conducted in other countries, 19 although there were different COVID-19 hospitalization and discharge measures. This could be attributed to age-related body changes, and some studies suggested that the changes influence the body's response through the following mechanisms: First, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein adheres to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and penetrates into the human body. But, because this enzyme may be less developed at a younger age, children are protected from coronavirus infection. 20,21 Second, in the body SARS-CoV-2 is split into two by TMPRSS2, a protein on the surface of human cells. These cracked proteins interact with the cell surface, and RNA is brought into the cell to proliferate. Therefore, the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is related to the activity of TMPRSS2 in the body; the expression of this protein increases significantly as the body ages, consequently, the severity of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly. On the contrary, children have very low levels of TMPRSS2 expression, so they may be relatively protected against severe forms of COVID-19. 22 Lastly, children's immune systems response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is different from that of adults. In the human body, there are many T cells that respond to viruses and regulate immunity. In severe cases of coronavirus, T cells decrease, resulting in decreased antiviral ability. However, there are more T cells in the children's body than in adults; the T cells suppress inflammatory reactions preventing them from developing into severe symptoms. In addition, there are many regulatory T cells, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the lung tissue of children; IL-10, which inhibits inflammatory factors such as the harmful cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6), may protect the children from SARS-CoV-2 infection. 23",

However, in children, COVID-19 is asymptomatic, and therefore they can be silent spreaders. Therefore, mitigation strategies must include thorough management and quarantine rules. Examples are some European countries, such as Belgium, which have fully reopened schools along with exhaustive preventive measures 24 . However, children with underlying diseases need to be protected from high-risk infection environments. This study additionally tried to determine the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children according to their social characteristics, but the results showed no statistically significant difference. However, earlier reports suggested that children's social factors may affect the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 25 For further clarification, additional studies with larger samples are required.
