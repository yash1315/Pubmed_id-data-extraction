Benefits, including access to specialist services from geographically distant locations and reduced costs and time to patients reported in this study, have long been recognised. 15 Recent technological advances in mobile communication, software and high-speed internet have increased feasibility of telehealth 15 and effective use in paediatric surgical conditions has been demonstrated. 16 17 While many parents reported receiving good care remotely, wanting this to continue post-pandemic, some felt disconnected from their healthcare team and that care was suboptimal. These views are echoed by clinicians. 18 Our study design prevented linking demographic data to individual responses. However, diagnostic complexity and the age of the child varied within the group. Younger children with OA/TOF tend to have more challenging health needs with postoperative morbidity greater for some. 9 19 We propose satisfaction with telehealth was greater for those at a stable point in their care than those with specific concerns. Dissatisfaction was not reported in other pre-pandemic studies evaluating use of telehealth with paediatric surgical patients. 16 20 This may be due to the speed with which telehealth was rolled out, with blanket, rather than targeted, use.",

Implementation of telehealth long term will be reliant on development of pathways enabling a balance of face-to-face and remote appointments with an analysis of the impact on care. 21 Bird and colleagues 22 have developed a comprehensive co-design framework to develop virtual clinics for the management of chronic illness in children. Use of such a framework would ensure feelings of disconnect identified in this study are minimised. Service providers must now actively engage with the rapidly evolving technology, such as use of remote stethoscopes, 23 understand barriers and support access to technology, 21 and develop appointment-specific telehealth guidance to optimise use of telehealth. 24 Parents described the impact that delays and cancellations had to their child's health and developmental progress, with access to community care particularly problematic. A number of parents highlighted the distress caused by feelings of being abandoned by healthcare services. Redeployment had a significant impact Open access on services identified as 'non-essential'. 25 Our findings mirror those of research with other rare diseases. 26 Continuation of 'non-essential' services, such as community speech and language therapy, during periods of high resource would reduce the need for escalation of care to emergency levels, promote development and support parental well-being. The wider harms caused by society-wide 'lockdown' have been well summarised 11 and are reflected in our findings; fear and anxiety, displaced non-COVID care, social isolation, stress and loss of income were all reported. Similar themes emerged from research exploring the experiences of parents caring for children with cancer. 27 Our findings highlight the diversity of experiences, typified by divergent management of anxiety that enabled some to transition to a more normal life, while others continued to isolate. Although individual differences in risk evaluation are inevitable, clinicians should acknowledge the burden of decision-making and seek to support by providing clear communication of the best available evidence to mitigate unnecessary isolation.",
