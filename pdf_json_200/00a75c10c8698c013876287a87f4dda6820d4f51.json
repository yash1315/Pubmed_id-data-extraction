The metrics of household economic instability and their associations with household characteristics and hardship require further examination in order to compare across studies, subgroups, and historical periods. This paper empirically examines and compares commonly used measures of income and employment instability, how these measures interrelate, vary by household characteristics, and how they predict household hardship. Using longitudinal data from the 2008 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), and focusing on households with children, this study examined a range of descriptive measures of economic instability, including in income, earnings, public assistance benefits, and employment status, and how these measures related to each other. Results indicate that overall rates of income and employment instability were high, particularly among less-educated families, those with young children, and those who did not own a home. Economic instability, particularly decreases in employment, was associated with increased household hardship three months later. Findings also show that the source of income included in the instability measure affects to the patterns identified and conclusions drawn, whereas the specific type of measure used matters less. These results highlight the instability of public assistance benefits and suggest that safety net programs must take economic instability into account when designing programs and benefits.",

Moffitt & Zhang, 2018) . In the aftermath of the Great Recession, many children lived in households that experienced high levels of economic instability-defined here to include both income and employment instability-such that for some households, instability was nearly a \"normative\" event (Meadows et al., 2015; Wolf & Morrissey, 2017) . While the recession caused instability and uncertainty for many (Kalleberg, 2009) , income instability had been rising steadily among low-socioeconomic status (SES) families over the prior three decades, resulting in growing differences in experiences of income instability between low-and high-SES households (Ha et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2015; Wolf et al., 2014; Wolf & Morrissey, 2017) , as well as between White and Black households (Wrigley-Field & Seltzer, 2020) . Further, since the 1990s, Black workers have been more likely to be displaced from their job compared to White workers (Wrigley-Field & Seltzer, 2020) , suggesting widening racial gaps in employment instability. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented economic instability and unpredictability for American families of color and those who were already falling behind (Governors, 2020) . This widening \"instability gap\" may be one explanation for the growing health and achievement gaps observed between low-and high-SES adults and children (Crosnoe et al., 2015; Reardon, 2011) . Unpredictable, frequent changes in resources, particularly in the context of poverty, contributes to stress and interferes with decision-making and other cognitive processes, resulting in cascading psychological effects (Gennetian & Shafir, 2015) . A growing body of research indicates that, in addition to average resource levels, major income and employment changes, or \"shocks,\" have short-and long-term implications for a range of negative health, educational, and economic outcomes for adults and children (Hardy, 2014; Hill, Morris, Gennetian, Wolf, & Tubbs, 2013; Pryor, Strandberg-larsen, Andersen, & Hulvej, 2019; Wolf & Morrissey, 2017) , including greater mortality (Pool et al., 2018) .",

As economic instability has become a regular part of life for many American families (Board of Governors, 2020; Mathematica Policy Research, 2018) and this area of research grows, the metrics of economic instability need further examination. Without consistent measures, it is difficult for researchers or policymakers to make meaningful comparisons across studies, different subgroups or populations, or historical periods. This is particularly important as the U.S. confronts the new and unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences. Use of consistent measures can reveal underlying trends and help identify groups particularly impacted by economic instability. Understanding fluctuations in families' resources during the country's most recent recession, the Great Recession, can inform policymakers on how best to target resources during the COVID-19-induced economic downturn, which is likely to be more severe and potentially longer-lasting than the Great Recession. Focusing on households with children, we address four research questions:",

Studies use different terms, definitions, and measures, making it difficult to compare findings or identify trends across time or subpopulations. For example, Wolf and Morrissey (2017) define economic instability as both income instability and employment instability, and operationalize these measures using percent and direction of change from month to month, whereas Hardy and Ziliak (2014) examine income volatility operationalized as the variance of the arc percent change (APC) in family income. In their review, Hill et al. (2017) define economic instability as \"the repeated changes in employment, income, or financial well-being over time\" as driven by changes in employment and earnings, family composition, and the receipt of public assistance benefits. Similarly, Western et al. (2016) discuss how often, economic instability stems from adverse events such as job loss, family dissolution, and poor health.",

Income is often used synonymously with earnings, and indeed, earnings account for the largest proportion of resources in the average household (Morduch & Schneider, 2017) . However, among low-income households in particular, non-earned income such as public assistance benefits constitutes an important source of resources in the U.S. and other highincome countries (Avram et al., 2019) . Safety net programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP; formerly known as food stamps) and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) are designed to provide temporary resources during periods of need (Hardy, 2017) . Ideally, participation in these programs smooths household resource levels to prevent the negative effects of income losses. Similarly, other safety net programs such as Medicaid and child care subsidies provide substantial in-kind benefits, supporting health care access (Goodman-Bacon, 2016; Simon et al., 2017) , financial security (Sommers et al., 2017) , and employment (Kaestner et al., 2017; Morrissey, 2017) .",

Likewise, public assistance programs can be burdensome to apply for and benefits are not always reliable or steady (Herd & Moynihan, 2018; Morduch & Schneider, 2017) . Most safety net programs require participants to enroll and re-enroll, which may involve visits to a social welfare agency.

Further, instability can be characterized as episodic or chronic. Episodic instability refers to discrete, acute \"shocks\" such as a job loss, whereas chronic instability refers to a sustained pattern of acute events, such as variable earnings due to seasonal or shifting work schedules. It is not yet known whether large changes are more consequential for family wellbeing than frequent, smaller changes in income or employment, or how the predictability of change relates to family outcomes. Some of this can be attributed to data limitations, as only a handful of nationally representative datasets (e.g., the Survey of Income and Program Participation [SIPP]) can be used to examine intra-year changes in income or employment.",

Importantly, the early childhood period is one in which families with young children face a multitude of expenses, from health care to child care, and are typically at the lowest earning years of their careers (Traub et al., 2016) .",

Evidence suggests that the effects of economic hardship on child well-being may depend on when economic hardship occurs relative to a child's developmental stage (Duncan et al., 2010) , but it is not understood how instability at different ages and stages may differentially relate to children's outcomes. Further, research highlights the negative effects of persistent poverty for children's development (McLoyd, 1998; Ratcliffe & Kalish, 2017) , but little research has compared how the experiences of persistent instability in household resources affect children and adults. One recent study using Norwegian data found that intermittent poverty, but not chronic poverty, was associated with child psychological difficulties after controlling for early risk factors (Pryor et al., 2019) . Less frequently studied is how positive income shocks affect family well-being-whether beneficial or problematic, as a source of stability-or how the experiences of households with unstable resources compare to those of stable but low-income households. Finally, given the lack of consistency in measures (e.g., percent change in income, APC), or the types of domains included (e.g., some studies use earnings alone), the field lacks an understanding of what definitions or measures may best represent consequential experiences of instability.",

The SIPP is uniquely suited for our purposes as it is one of only a few nationally representative datasets that captures intrayear income changes 1 . Our unit of analysis is households, which were surveyed from September 2008 through December 2013 in the sixteen waves of data collected in this survey. During each wave of data collection (every 4 months), the SIPP asked participants to share their personal information pertaining to the month of the interview and for each of the three months prior. The initial survey sample size of the SIPP was roughly 400,000 household-months per wave (approximately 42,000 households followed over time). As with all longitudinal datasets, there were missing data, both due to attrition and to households being unavailable at certain waves. We collapsed this data into a household-month level data set containing both householdlevel information (e.g., total household income instability) and person-level characteristics for household members (e.g. reference person's employment status) for each month. Our final analytic sample consisted of 621,015 household-months for 24,083 households with at least one child under the age of 18 2 . We excluded wave 16 (households surveyed from September to December 2013) because there is no data for Rotation 2 due to the government shutdown in October 2013. We used all monthly economic data available in the SIPP, providing us with monthly household income and employment information up to 12 times per year, and up to 60 months (i.e., time points) per household, beginning in May 2008 and ending in July 2013 3 . All analyses are weighted at the household-level and thus can be generalized to U.S. households with one or more children 4 .",

Instability in total income was much lower for families that owned their own homes, and for families with school-age children compared to those with young children. Home ownership, usually the most valuable asset a family has, may buffer against the negative effects of instability (Acs & Nichols, 2010; Mckernan et al., 2009) , and has become more important in the context of rising housing costs. Since 1995, the median asking rent has soared by 70 percent, while incomes have remained flat (Desmond, 2016) . Most low-income families spend more than half of their income on housing and constantly face the threat of eviction. However, several public programs have asset limits (e.g., in many states SNAP benefits are only available to families with assets below a certain amount) (Ratcliffe et al., 2016) . Asset limits may discourage savings, which can be detrimental for the financial security of families (Chen & Lerman, 2005) . Further, the historical context of our analysis was one of unprecedented foreclosure rates, also shown to have negative effects on health (Currie & Tekin, 2015) . It is possible that in our study, home ownership served as an indicator of better economic and overall well-being as well as a measure of assets. Further, several measures indicated that income and employment were more volatile among households with young children compared to those with school-age children, consistent with income dynamics surrounding the birth of a child (Stanczyk, 2016) and that paid family leave is relatively uncommon in the U.S. (Laughlin, 2011) .",

Public assistance benefits (predominantly TANF) showed the greatest stability, although in most states, absolute TANF benefits are quite low. In 2016, the average monthly benefit across the 50 states and the District of Columbia was $521 for a family of three (UKCPR, 2018) .

For example, previous research showing that most families exiting the child care subsidy system remain eligible (Grobe, Weber, & Davis, 2008; Ha, Magnuson, & Ybarra, 2012; Ha & Meyer, 2010) led to a requirement that state subsidy programs use a minimum 12-month continuous eligibility period to enhance stability.

            "text": "Despite its strengths, including the use of monthly, longitudinal, nationally representative data, this study has limitations. First, the study is descriptive in nature. We examined unadjusted bivariate correlations between instability and later hardship, which were relatively small and cannot be interpreted as causal. Notably, the pattern of results are consistent with prior research (Pryor et al., 2019) . Second, seam bias in the SIPP may lead to less accurate reporting of income during the non-reference months, which may inflate or underestimate our measures of income instability (Moore, 2007) . To address these recall bias concerns, we re-ran our analyses after keeping only the interviewees' fourth reference month (the interview month), finding substantively similar patterns (results are available upon request). Third, this study does not capture receipt of private cash assistance that could smooth income volatility (Pilkauskas et al., 2017) , which may help explain the small correlations between economic instability and hardship.",

            "text": "This study also examined a period of economic downturn and recovery, and our patterns may not generalize to other historical contexts. Finally, several of our analyses rely on the APC, which has advantages and limitations. For example, the APC is less reliant on average income and is a measure of magnitude and direction of change, but the APC assumes that the gains and losses in income can be treated symmetrically. Further, although zero earnings can be included in an APC measure, the measure assumes that households have non-zero earnings in at least one year. In addition, using the variance of the log earnings as a measure of income instability entails dropping individuals with zero earnings, presumably underestimating income instability (Ziliak et al., 2011) . This means that the APC may not capture instability among very low-income households, in particular. However, APC measures of income instability are highly correlated with measures that are meaningful to household resources like percent change in income, as well as hardship three months later, but are less reliant on average or base income levels. Importantly, however, we did not test all possible measures of income instability, which could include coefficients of variation or number of months with stable earnings. Future research would benefit from an exhaustive review of the measures used to assess income instability to inform related research.",

We examined how these measures of economic instability varied with household characteristics and hardship. Our findings highlight the prevalence of economic instability among American households with children, the connections between economic instability and multiple forms of hardship, and for future research, the importance of specificity regarding the definitions and components of economic instability that are measured. Many questions remain regarding the role of economic instability in contributing to socioeconomic inequality and how public policies can be improved to reduce its harm. These findings have important implications for understanding and supporting families during the current and future large-scale economic crises.",
