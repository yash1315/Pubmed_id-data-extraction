Participants included 16 pwCF and 14 parents, who completed four individual telehealth sessions with a psychologist. Stress ratings, Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder, PHQ-8 and GAD-7, were completed, in addition to Feasibility and Satisfaction ratings. Results: Ratings of stress significantly decreased from pre-to post-testing for pwCF (paired t(14) = \u22124.06, p < .01) and parents (paired t = \u22125.2, p < .001). A large percentage of both groups scored in the clinical range for depression and anxiety at baseline (pwCF: depression/anxiety = 71%; parents: depression = 57%; anxiety = 79%); a large proportion (20%-40%) reported moderate to severe symptomatology. Significant reductions in depression for pwCF were found (pre: M = 8.0 to post: M = 4.7; paired t(14) = 2.8, p < .05) but not anxiety (pre: M = 6.9 to post: M = 5.6, t(14) = 1.2, p = NS-non-significant). Parental depression decreased for parents (pre: M = 6.4 to post: M = 5.1, t(14) = \u22122.5, p < .05), but not anxiety (pre: M = 8.1 to post: M = 7.9, t(14) = \u22120.2, p = NS).

            "text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019 ), spread in Hubei, China. The virus caused a variety of symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic/mild symptoms to serious impairments and death. 1 The spread of COVID-19 has led to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, 2 causing high levels of stress, fear, and anxiety about this extremely contagious, rapidly spreading virus. 3 Anxiety was related to fears of being infected, infecting others, and concerns about its associated comorbidities and high mortality rate. Loss of normal routines, reduction of activities, and a severe economic recession contributed to increasing stress and worsening mental health. A previous systematic review on large-scale disasters revealed increased depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance misuse, and domestic violence. 4 The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was also associated with increased psychological distress in patients and clinicians. 5 The first study in China on the impact of COVID-19 found elevated depression and anxiety in a sample of 1210 individuals: 17% reported moderate-severe depression and 29% moderate-severe anxiety. 6 A study in Hong Kong screened 500 adults using wellvalidated screening tools (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder-PHQ-9 and GAD-7), reporting high levels of depression (19%) and anxiety (14%). Further, 25% of the sample reported a worsening of mental health due to the pandemic. 7 Adolescents in China also reported high levels of depression (43.7%) and anxiety (37.4%) using PHQ-9 and GAD-7. 8 Similar elevations in psychological distress have been documented across the world. [9] [10] [11] As the pandemic spread throughout Italy and Europe, new mental health concerns were raised by people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) and parent caregivers, who are already at increased risk for depression and anxiety. [12] [13] [14] Before the pandemic, numerous studies have indicated that psychological symptoms in pwCF are associated with worse adherence, more frequent hospitalizations, and earlier mortality. 15, 16 In response to this pandemic, several studies have been conducted to evaluate its impact on pwCF and caregivers. 14, 17, 18 Havermans et al. 17 reported on 80 adults with cystic fibrosis (CF), 66 adults who had received a lung transplant, and 73 parent caregivers.",

The top-ranked concerns for adults with CF were \"afraid of being infected by the virus\" and \"extra alert for dangerous situations,\" and \"I cannot adhere to my usual routines.\" These same top three concerns were also endorsed by parents. Thus, anxiety and fear were the predominant psychological issues for both. Although both groups reported disruption in their daily routines, they also reported spending more time on nebulized treatments and airway clearance. Increased stress, negative thoughts, and trouble sleeping were also reported by both pwCF and parents. 17 In a study of adolescents with CF and their mothers, 18 anxiety was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Mothers of children with CF reported higher trait anxiety than age-matched controls. In contrast, healthy children and their parents reported higher state anxiety than the group with CF, unless the child was colonized with Pseudomonas infection. In that case, their state anxiety was also quite elevated.",

It targeted adolescents/young adults with CF and caregivers, providing them with cognitive-behavioral strategies to cope with the stress and emotional challenges of the lockdown in March. The lockdown was highly restrictive: schools and universities were closed, people were told to work from home, and individuals could go out only for essential tasks (e.g., supermarket, pharmacy). Access to routine healthcare also changed for pwCF and many were afraid of coming to the CF Center; in-person appointments were reserved for those with serious health problems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral telehealth intervention to reduce symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety in pwCF and parents during the lockdown. This 4-session telehealth intervention was delivered via the internet and was aimed at reducing psychological symptomatology. Feasibility and Satisfaction were assessed.",

The mean score on the PHQ-8 was 8.0 for pwCF and 6.4 for parents, respectively. The mean score on the GAD-7 was 6.9 for pwCF and 8.1 for parents, respectively. Among patients, 71% scored in the elevated range on both depression and anxiety, with most in the mild-moderate range. Among parents, 57% scored in the elevated range of depression, with most reporting mild-moderate severity, and 79% scored in the elevated range for anxiety, with 45% scoring in the moderate-severe range (Table 3) . indicating that it ranges from a medium to large effect. Symptoms of anxiety decreased, 6.9 at pretest to 5.6 at posttest, but were not statistically significant (paired t test, t(15) = 1.2, p = NS-non-significant; Figure 2 ).",

            "text": "tervention were positive, decreases in anxiety did not meet the statistical threshold for significance for either pwCF or parents. Several possible reasons may account for this. First, COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus and there was no information about how this new virus might affect pwCF.Given that CF is a very serious, underlying pulmonary condition, there was considerable fear that pwCF would be more negatively affected than others, and the CF healthcare community did not know if pwCF were uniquely vulnerable. Second, during and after the intervention, people were still living with this crisis every day. Triggers for anxiety were ubiquitous (e.g., news, mortality rates) and the extreme social isolation in Italy may have also raised levels of anxiety. Finally, many people lost their jobs because all services and businesses were closed, and children and adolescents were not able to go to school. The pandemic caused a major economic recession in Italy, as in other parts of the world, and this might have limited reductions in anxiety.The psychological support intervention was very brief, only four sessions, but was effective. It utilized basic skills derived from CBT, including relaxation training, cognitive reframing, exercises to increase positive emotions (e.g., music), good sleep hygiene, and physical exercises for home. It was delivered via telehealth with a clinical psychologist, which enabled pwCF and parents to access the intervention easily and efficiently. There were no technical difficulties because it utilized simple technology (video call) and if necessary, could be conducted by phone.",
