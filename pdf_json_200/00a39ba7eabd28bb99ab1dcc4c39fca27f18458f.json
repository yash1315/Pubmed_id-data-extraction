            "text": "Previous studies conducted during the 2003 SARS outbreak showed adverse psychological reactions among healthcare workers. In this population, high levels of stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression (Lee et al., 2007) associated with uncertainty, stigmatization, reluctance to work and resignation (Bai et al., 2004; Maunder et al., 2003) were observed. Several studies found that the emergency nursery department was more likely to develop distress and behavioral disconnection Shih et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2005) . At present, facing the pandemic caused by COVID-19, health workers who take care of these patients experience similar effects on their mental health. The public health crisis creates an environment of uncertainty and stress that demands both assessment and containment of health personnel. So far, most of the studies about COVID-19 have focused on epidemiological investigations, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Few studies have investigated the mental J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f health problems that affect health workers during the pandemic (Spoorthy et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) In hospital settings, the burnout syndrome has been extensively studied, even though the most widely accepted definition of burnout is that proposed by Maslach & Jackson (1986) who identified it as a three-dimensional syndrome involving: a) high emotional exhaustion (tiredness and diminished personal resources to face the demands of the task) , b) high depersonalization (development of a negative and insensitive attitude towards the recipients of the service), and c) diminished sense of personal accomplishment (perception that professional achievements fall below personal expectations and low personal self-worth). The study of burnout is important because its negative effects can impact both on the professional who suffers it, causing different signs and symptoms, and also on the health institution itself, by increasing staff absenteeism, and on the quality of care provided by increasing medical errors and diminishing patient safety .",

Decreased AP values have been reported to be associated with a negative evaluation of the abilities to carry out work tasks. The increase in burnout parameters in workers who are in direct contact with patients may be due to the fact that physicians and nurses are facing a high workload in providing health services. Burnout among physicians has been found to be associated with a wide range of occupational stressors, which are likely to increase during COVID-19 pandemic (Pappa et al., 2020; Rajkumar, 2020) .",

This finding becomes relevant since depersonalization has been associated in different studies with anxiety, and significant levels of stress and emotional hyperactivity (Michal et al., 2009) . Several studies have shown that when subjects do not have personal resources to face conflict situations, depersonalization acts as a dysfunctional coping strategy (Magdalena Escamilla-Quintal, 2008; Sierra-Siegert, 2008; Gil Monte et al.,1998) . Thompson and Jaque (2017) state that to counteract the negative effects of greater emotionality, people with high depersonalization need to acquire and use even more task-oriented strategies to compensate their emotional tendencies. In this sense, our interdisciplinary work team has implemented an Online Training Program to Improve Stress Management aimed to health workers belonging to the Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas \"Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn\", Buenos Aires University (UBA).",
