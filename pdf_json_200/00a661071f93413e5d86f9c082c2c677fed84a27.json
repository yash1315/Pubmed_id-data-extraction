Even though there have been significant advances in the field of financial econometrics, many crises have been documented throughout the world in the last decades. An explanation for this discrepancy is that many contemporary models are too complex and cannot be easily understood and implemented in the financial industry (Fama in to bridge this theory-practice gap, we present a computational method based on the leverage effect. This method allows us to focus on financial theory and remove complexity. Examining the US stock market (2000-2020), we provide empirical evidence that our newly suggested approach, which uses only the most appropriate observation period, significantly increases the accuracy of the Conventional Delta Normal VaR model and generates VaR estimations which are as accurate as those of advanced econometric models, such as GARCH(1,1).",

A significant aspect of this flow of funds is how the financial system allows risk to be shared and who bears it (Allen et al. 2004) . Therefore, the protection of lenders/investors is vital to the stability of the financial system and largely relies on the ability of lenders/investors to accurately assess the financial risk in their transactions/decisions. For these reasons, the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) introduced a set of regulations (CESR 2010) which focus on financial markets, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) issued recommendations (Basel Accords I, II, and III) which focus on the banking industry.",

Computer scientists usually describe this issue using the phrase \"Garbage in, Garbage out\". When we use the CDNVaR model, we assume that the upcoming performance is similar to the last x days (data inputs).

In one sub-period, longer (or smaller) data inputs may generate more accurate VaR estimations than the VaR that is estimated by the last x days. Hendricks (1996) provides empirical evidence that simple and conventional VaR models capture market trend changes faster when they are based on the most recent observations than the respective models that are based on longer-term historical data. However, as he shows, the conventional VaR models that are based on short observation periods present an increased number of low deviated violations/overshootings due to measurement error. Therefore, according to his findings, there is a trade-off between representativeness and accuracy. This trade-off is significantly influenced by the length of the observation period which is used in the estimation process. Vasileiou and Samitas (2020) apply the legal requirements and confirm the findings by Hendricks (1996) on short vs. long observation periods. 7 Our goal is to examine whether a model, the CDNVaR model in our study, could become more representative (by capturing market trend changes) and more accurate (by presenting fewer overshootings) when the appropriate data length is used as inputs in the estimation process.",

            "text": "As Eq. 2 shows, the VaR estimation is exclusively depended on the sd value, which in turn depends on the observation period from which the sd is calculated. The legal framework requires that the history of risk factors should be at least 1 Year (BCBS, 1995, p. 9; CESR, 2010, p. 26) , 10 hence there are regulatory limitations on the only parameter that can significantly influence the estimations of the VaR model. Could the CDNVaR model become more accurate and representative if we remove these limitations? Vasileiou and Pantos (2020) and Vasileiou (2019) show that the mandatory minimum of 250 data inputs may lead to inaccurate VaR estimations, 11 and following their suggestions we remove the 250-observation threshold from our estimation process. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the S&P500 returns during the examined period, 2000-2020, and shows that the returns are not normally distributed: skewness lower than zero, Kurtosis higher than 3, and the Jarque-Bera test quantitatively confirms that the times series does not follow the normal distribution. Figure 1 shows the performance and the daily returns of the S&P500 index during the examined period . We can observe some features that are common in financial time series: (1) the leverage effect because when the prices of the index fall, volatility increases (spikes of the daily returns are bigger), and (2) volatility clustering because volatility appears in bunches (Brooks, 2019) . These findings raise concerns about the accuracy of the CDNVaR model because it generates linear VaR estimations (Eq. 2). The backtesting procedure could confirm (or not) our concerns that the CDNVaR model may not fit our data sample. According to the legal framework, a VaR model is considered accurate when up to four overshootings per 250 VaR estimations (approximately a year) are documented (BCBS, 1996; CESR, 2010) . More than 4 overshootings per year (\"4 overshootings rule\") mean that the model is not accurate at the 99% c.l. and a revision is required, and/or penalties should be imposed. 12 Table 2 shows several versions of the CDNVaR model, when 20-, 125-, 250-, and 500-day observation periods are used. Part (a) of Table 2 presents some descriptive statistics on the VaR backtesting procedure that are not examined by the legislation, but are useful to our analysis. The results indicate: Fig. 1 The performance and the daily returns of the S&P500 Index during the 2000-2020 period 12 The four overshootings rule per year (250 observations) backtesting procedure that the legal framework suggests is similar to the Kupiec test (1995) which is based on the binary distribution and examines only the number of oveshootings during an examined period. Some scholars suggest that if the \"accuracy issue\" is limited only to the \"less than four violations rule\", several moral issues emerge. Popularizing some more advanced backtesting suggestions (Mc Neil and Frey 2000; Mc Neil et al. 2005) , in this study we examine not only the overshooting number but also the difference/deviation between (a) the real losses and the estimated VaR, and (b) the real returns and the estimated VaR. The smaller these deviations are, the more representative of the examined financial conditions the VaR estimations are.",

Firstly, the average deviation in the 250-day CDNVaR is narrower than the respective measure in the 500-day CDNVaR (on average 0.99% vs 1.16%). 15 Secondly, the narrower and average deviations cannot be attributed to more conservative estimations (the average value of the VaR estimations, hereafter \"average VaR\", are 2.62% and 2.65%, for the 250-day and 500-day CDNVaR, respectively). 16 We consider the 250-day CDNVaR the best amongst the examined models when the total period is examined.

It will be more accurate according to the law, but in practice it is just more conservative.",

Regarding the model, it is known that the CDNVaR may be accurate in normal periods, but fails when fat tails and non-linearities are observed (Jorion, 2007) . The empirical evidence confirmed our assumptions that a linear model, such as the CDNVaR, is not appropriate for our data sample (the best versions of the model fail to meet the 4 overshootings rule in 10 out of the 21 years). How can we make the CDNVaR model non-linear and more accurate?",

            "text": "One avenue to explore is to waive the legal requirement that requires at least 250 observations for estimating VaR and examine whether this can potentially generate more accurate VaR estimations. The findings of Table 2 show that shorter observation periods may produce to more accurate VaR estimations when a financial trend changes because fewer observations lead to significant changes in the s.d. and VaR estimations from day to day (Eq. 2). This allows the model to capture market changes faster than the models that use longer observation periods (Vasileiou & Samitas, 2020) . However, the CDNVaR models that are heavily based on recent observations fail when normal growth periods are examined due to the measurement error (Hendricks, 1996) . Can we reduce the measurement error and improve the CDNVaR estimations? A data filtering approach could be the solution. When the financial conditions are normal the model should adjust data length in order to avoid the measurement error issue. Similarly, when the financial trend changes the model should use a short observation period in order to accurately capture these changes in the financial conditions. So, we should not use a constant data length in order to estimate VaR. Therefore, our goal is to find a procedure/algorithm which selects the most appropriate dataset, so we need to examine in detail how the CDNVaR model works. According to Eq. 2, s.d. is crucial for accurate VaR estimations, thus data length is a significant parameter for accurate VaR estimations. For this reason, we calculate the standard deviations using 20-, 125-, 250-, and 500-day observations, and we empirically test their correlations to the next day's returns. (Following Hull and White's (1998) suggestion, we first present the specific relationship for the previous 21-year period , and then for the 21-year period (2000-2020) under Table 3 (a) and they show that the correlation between volatility and next day returns does not provide any significant information for the upcoming performance of the stock market, even though Fig. 1 shows the existence of the leverage effect. This means that we should make some adjustments in order to appoint the leverage effect. The CDNVaR model relies on past volatility in order to estimate a future worstcase scenario. The specific relationship should be negative because according to the leverage effect standard deviations should increase when crises are coming, and vice versa. VaR tries to capture the worst-case scenario, so perhaps the negative relationship between next day returns and the volatility of the current day can become clearer when we only include negative return days in the correlation estimations.",

In this case, the longer the observation period is, the more inaccurate the VaR estimations (Garbage In, Garbage Out).

On the other hand, we should mention that when the OSDDNVaR model fails to meet the \"4 overshootings\" rule, it presents in most of the cases a higher number of overshootings per year than the GARCH(1,1). 19 Therefore, the newly suggested approach which is based on financial theory and does not use complex mathematics, not only significantly improves the VaR estimation of a conventional model, but also appears to be as accurate as the advanced and widely accepted GARCH(1,1) VaR model. The non-constant observation period offers flexibility to the model and allows it to use the most appropriate data length period in order to provide the best possible VaR estimations. This approach could be applied in advanced models, such as the GARCH family models. The filtering method will again suggest the optimal data observation period and the accuracy of the estimations will further improve.",

When the CDNVaR model is applied, the accuracy of the model's estimation depends on the appropriate data length. On the one hand, a short observation period may be more appropriate for accurate VaR estimations during periods of changes in the financial trend, but during normal periods the short observation data inputs may lead to measurement errors. On the other hand, longer observation periods may be a solution for the measurement error, but when the financial trend changes, there are a lot of inappropriate data included in the estimation process, which leads to inaccurate VaR estimations for the upcoming period.",

A data filtering approach could provide a computational solution based on financial theory and produce more accurate VaR estimations without resorting to complex mathematical models. This way we present an approach that significantly improves the accuracy of the existing VaR models, can be easily applied and understood, and can contribute to financial stability.",
