Methods: We conducted a survey of rising fourth-year medical students. Primary outcome was the change in students' plans to apply to residency in orthopaedic surgery as measured by Likert scale response. Secondary outcomes were students' concerns about applying to residency during the pandemic. Results: A total of 462 students were planning to apply to residency in orthopaedic surgery. Women said that they were \"less likely\" to apply to orthopaedic surgery because of the pandemic (14.9% versus 5.5% of men, P , 0.001). Students identifying as Black/African American said that they were \"less likely\" to apply (16.9% compared with 8.8 of non-Hispanic White, P , 0.001). Students said that they had \"somewhat fewer\" or \"many fewer\" opportunities to get adequate exposure to orthopaedic surgery to make a specialty choice (88.9% of students). Discussion: We support the development of robust student advising and mentorship networks to address the uncertainty inherent in applying to residency during a global pandemic and curtail the racial and sex disparities discovered in this survey.",

The loss of this clinical exposure also has limited the capability for students to engage with faculty members, making it challenging to establish advising relationships that could potentially blossom into mentorships. In an effort to continue education efforts during the pandemic, medical schools have transitioned to online and distance learning. [8] [9] [10] The in-person clinical rotation is a keystone of orthopaedic student training and is therefore difficult to replace with other forms of education. 11 Orthopaedic residency applicants rely on these clinical rotations to demonstrate their interest in the field and to evaluate residency programs. The rotations offer attending and resident physicians the opportunity to kindle relationships with students in an attempt to identify future residents and potential mentees. 12, 13 Students who complete an away rotation at a given institution have an increased chance of matching with that institution compared with peers who do not complete the same away rotation. 12 Thus, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the inability for students to complete away rotations has changed the residency application processes.",

Our hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic would change fourth-year medical students' plans to apply to orthopaedic surgery, a finding that would be associated with sex, race, and geographic region in which a given student attends medical school was validated. Women were notably less likely to plan to apply to residency in orthopaedic surgery because of the pandemic, whereas Black/African American students were more likely to have a change in their application [17] [18] [19] Our hypothesis was also substantiated regarding student concerns about the pandemic and its effect on the residency application process. Students planning to apply to residency in orthopaedic surgery were concerned about many facets of the residency application process, such as opportunities to learn about other programs, ability to obtain meaningful letters of recommendation, and the choice of a year off before applying. Medical student advisors can use this information to guide discussion with potential applicants. Considering that 82.8% of students had away rotations canceled, virtual opportunities for students to learn about programs will be important. Our results suggest that students are willing to participate in on-line activities to garner more information about programs. Development of digitally based advising programs could further help students who do not have a home program or have had limited interaction with faculty at their institution. Such engagement could further amplify the strengths of a given program from a student perspective and could facilitate mentorship opportunities. We recognize that the mentorship is a longitudinal process, but endeavors of this type can certainly promote student advising at a minimum. Such opportunities could only help students, especially because 18.6% of students said that their home programs had not discussed logistical changes to the application process brought about by COVID-19.",

            "text": "Our study has numerous strengths. We have a large sample size of students well-distributed geographically. The average number of applicants to orthopaedic surgery per year for the past five years was 1,262, indicating that with 462 participants identifying as fourth-year medical students planning to apply to residency in orthopaedic surgery, we captured approximately 36.6% of the applicant pool. 22 Our study has certain weaknesses. Our data capture student planning for the application process and therefore do not capture whether a given student pursued a given action (for example, whether a student applied to residency in orthopaedic surgery after responding to the survey that he or she would apply to residency in orthopaedic surgery). Despite this limitation, we find our data valuable because it exposed student planning at an important point of the application cycle, which can guide mentorship. In addition, previous data show that orthopaedic applicant response to surveys reflects data accrued by the National Residency Matching Program. 21 Another weakness is our lack of a control group. Instead, our comparison groups were among differing subsets of the medical student population and among those who identified as either planning to apply or not apply to orthopaedic surgery. A historical control group specifically would aid in analysis because it would show whether previous trends regarding applicant demographics are similar or different from those revealed by our survey. Our study also has a potential selection bias because students who were more likely to be concerned about the effect of the pandemic on their application may be more likely to attend the webinar. A better study population would include every rising fourthyear medical student who before the pandemic had declared that he or she would apply in orthopaedic surgery. However, because of the large sample size of 462 of an anticipated 750 applicants per program during a typical application cycle, we do not consider this detrimental to interpreting our results. Another weakness is that we did not collect other demographic data, such as socioeconomic status, that also can influence residency decision-making.",
