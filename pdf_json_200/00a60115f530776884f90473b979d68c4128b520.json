SARS-CoV-2 data normalized to flow improved correlations to reported COVID-19 cases for some plants but normalizing to a spiked recovery control (BCoV) or a fecal marker (PMMoV or HF183) generally reduced correlations. High frequency sampling demonstrated that a minimum of two samples collected per week was needed to maintain accuracy in trend analysis. We found a significantly different ratio of COVID-19 cases to SARS-CoV-2 loads in one of three large communities, suggesting a higher rate of undiagnosed cases. These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance can provide a useful community-wide metric to assess the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. : medRxiv preprint progression through communities. Following the first reports of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in untreated sewage [5] , wastewater surveillance has emerged as a promising tool for measuring community-wide levels of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 [6] . As wastewater testing is not influenced by the availability of clinical testing resources, access to testing, or healthcare-seeking behavior, measuring SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater has the potential to offer insight into infection trends in the community that clinical testing might not capture.",

Although SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a respiratory pathogen, it is also shed in feces at concentrations up to 10 7 copies per gram [7, 8] , which allows the viral RNA to be detected readily in wastewater treatment plant influent. However, SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in feces vary widely among infected individuals and over the course of infection [7,8], which makes it difficult to extrapolate the number of infected individuals from wastewater concentrations. For example, using the reported shedding rates, which span five orders of magnitude, detection of the virus in wastewater could represent 100 to 6 million infected individuals [9]. Although empirical infection prevalence estimates have not yet been achieved with wastewater surveillance, retrospective analysis has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent or wastewater solids correlate to clinical case trends [10-13].",

Community-wide burdens of COVID-19 have been difficult to assess, especially with limited availability of clinical testing at the beginning of the pandemic and spread by asymptomatic carriers [1, 2] , which has been reported to be as high as 30% [3, 4] . These difficulties result in under-ascertainment of cases and complicate tracking the transmission One major challenge to implementing widespread SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance is the lack of a standard method. Enveloped viruses partition between the solid and liquid phases in waste streams [16] and research is underway to evaluate concentration methods for these viruses in wastewater [17, 18] . Using common controls can allow for comparison of results across different methods or laboratories [19] . A variety of surrogates have been used to estimate recovery, including bovine coronavirus (BCoV) [12, 17] , bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) [20] , and human coronavirus (OC43) [21] . In addition, normalizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations to WWTP flow, the estimated amount of human fecal material in the samples (the fecal strength), and/or the population contributing to the viral load is needed to compare across samples and WWTPs. One promising candidate for normalizing SARS-CoV-2 concentration data is the pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), found in high concentrations in sewage [22] . This fecal marker is introduced into humans through the diet [23] and is attractive because, as a single stranded RNA virus, it may also serve as a RNA recovery control. Overall, it is critical to determine the technical variability in SARS-CoV-2 RNA measurements in day-to-day samples to enable timely interpretation of these data, i.e., How much of a change can be attributed to sampling or measurement variability versus changes in the community SARS-CoV-2 loads?",

In this study, we found lengthening the contact time of BCoV with wastewater from 30 minutes to a maximum of 48 hrs did not yield improved BCoV recovery ( Figure S3) , suggesting additional factors specific to the sewer environment may be influencing recovery differences between SARS-CoV-2 and surrogate viruses used as recovery controls. We also found that in general, samples with higher TSS did not yield higher SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. While BCoV recovery did not correlate to N1 or N2 recoveries, we did find that a very low BCoV recovery (e.g., <1%) was a reliable flag for method failure and typically resulted in very low or absent N1 or N2 detection.",

We also hypothesized that comparing the per capita case rate with SARS-CoV-2 loads in wastewater could be used as an undiagnosed cases indicator. We did find that the one community with significantly lower ratios of diagnosed cases:SARS-CoV-2 loads also had a low testing rate, which would support this hypothesis.

For all three weeks, flow-weighted composite samples were collected daily from Sunday through Thursday (30 samples total; 5 days per week for 3 weeks at 2 plants). Sample filtration and nucleic acid extraction Wastewater samples were mixed thoroughly by vigorous shaking, then 25 mL of each sample were pipetted into 50 mL tubes containing a magnesium chloride solution to reach a final concentration of 25 mM. We used BCoV that was obtained as the Calf Guard cattle vaccine (Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ) as a control for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA recovery. The BCoV vaccine was rehydrated and 5 \u00b5L (about 100,000 cp/\u00b5L) was used for each sample filtration. See Supplemental Text 1 and Supplemental Figure S3 for additional details on the BCoV protocol and optimizations.",

However, HF183 concentrations were less variable than PMMoV across all WWTPs (HF183 RSD = 53% vs. PMMoV RSD = 184% for HA filters or 102% for direct extraction). Overall, neither of the human markers correlated to the flow for each plant(Figure S5). No trend was observed between decreasing variability of either marker or increasing population size, suggesting that the variability was not driven by sample size of the population.
