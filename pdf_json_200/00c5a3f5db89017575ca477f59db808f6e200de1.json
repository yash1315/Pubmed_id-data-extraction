            "text": "COVID-19 pandemic has almost made hand sanitization a ritual resulting in a steep increase in the frequency of hand sanitization and an unprecedented surge in demand for hand sanitizers. In fact, several governments had to ration hand sanitizers in the retail outlets and over the counter chemist shops. Additionally, Indian government has put a cap on the prices of hand sanitizers. Currently, large sections of global and Indian population are grappling under financial crises. Therefore, mandatory hand sanitization has made an unwelcoming, yet unavoidable addition to the already-hard-to-maintain-grocery-list. Here, we have compared the anti-microbial efficacy of Patanjali Hand Sanitizer (PHS), developed and marketed by Patanjali Ayurved Ltd. (an India-based food and herbal medicine company) with one of the topmost hand sanitizers currently used under clinical set-ups. PHS has anti-microbial efficacy comparable to that of the standard hand sanitizer. Besides, disc diffusion and time-dependent thumb print assays showed that PHS has longer retentivity on the applied surfaces, suggesting lesser consumption of the sanitizer and concomitant relaxation on the monthly grocery budget. Observed anti-bacterial potency of PHS is attributed to the disruption of bacterial cell membrane, as employed by alcohol-based hand sanitizers. A rough estimation revealed that PHS is ~ 4.3 times cost effective than the standard hand sanitizer used as the positive control in this study. Taken together, PHS is a suitable alternative for existing hand sanitizers available in the market that can relax the demand-supply strain and soften significantly the burden of monthly expenditure on hand sanitizers.",

Hands are the major mode of transmission of infectious microbes from one person to another (WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care 2009). According to the Center for Disease control and prevention (CDC) approximately 2 million people got affected by hospital acquired infection per year. The public health sector like CDC and WHO suggest to use hand sanitizer for preventing spreading of infectious microbes through hands (WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care 2009).",

Therefore, a hand sanitizer with anti-microbial efficacy equivalent to that of the existing ones in the market but with added advantage of longer post-application retention time will help in (a) cope up with the ever increasing demand for hand sanitizer by facilitating lesser consumption, and (b) reducing the economic burden on the masses by decreasing the per head consumption.",

We chose a well-established alcohol based hand sanitizer that has been in commercial use for past 50 years in various clinical and laboratory set ups as positive control to be used as a standard to compare the efficacy of PHS. To avoid any conflict of interest, we are deliberately not disclosing the name of the positive control here. Thumb prints of volunteers (n = 30) were collected before and after sanitization with either positive control or herbal hand sanitizer. Thumb prints collected from the same volunteers after washing with water were included as experimental (negative) control to ensure the authenticity of the methodology employed. Sanitization potency was determined based on the number of colonies that grew before and after sanitization in each case. Representative digital images of the plates with unwashed or without sanitization thumb prints showed the starting microbial load for each volunteer (Fig. 1a(i) ). Washing with water did not reduce the microbial load much (Fig. 1a(ii) ). Rubbing thumbs with the standard sanitizer, as expected, showed complete removal of the microbial load as evident from absence of any colony on the plate (Fig. 1a(iii) ). Interestingly, rubbing thumbs with PHS was also able to remove the bacteria almost completely, exhibiting a comparable performance to that of the standard hand sanitizer (Fig. 1a(iv) ). Sanitization efficacy was quantitatively perceived as percent (%) antimicrobial potency and calculated as percent reduction in colony number after rubbing the thumbs with water (for negative control), standard (for positive control) and PHS (Fig. 1b) . We observed an average (\u00b1 SD) 23.18 (\u00b1 9.75) % antimicrobial potency of water. Obviously, the alcohol based standard exhibited almost 100% antimicrobial potency (calculated 99.40 \u00b1 1.60%). PHS was equally efficient in reducing the microbial load as the standard with a calculated average antimicrobial potency of 94.30 \u00b1 7.73%. From these observations, we concluded that PHS has an antimicrobial potency comparable to one of the topmost commercial hand sanitizer available in the market.",

Discs soaked in standard hand sanitizer (+ ve control) did not have any such bacterial growth free surrounding zones. b Sustained anti-microbial activity resulting from protracted availability of PHS from the applied surface is represented through digital images of thumb prints containing agar plates. These prints were collected from three of the volunteers (who participated earlier) before and at 0. 30 and 60 min after sanitizing their thumbs with either standard hand sanitizer (+ ve control) or PHS inhibition around the disc with PHS in case of both S. epidermidis and S. aureus, to our surprise, we did not find any such zones around the discs with standard hand sanitizer on either of the bacterial plates (Fig. 2a) . Indeed, this was quite intriguing and suggested an absence of the standard sanitizer in the discs. A plausible reason for this could be quick evaporation of the sanitizer from the discs. In contrast, the gel based formulation is likely to reduce the rate of evaporation of the constituting alcohol in PHS. This suggested that the PHS could be retained on the surface where it is applied for comparatively longer period. With kind participation from three of our previous volunteers, we verified the above possibility through a similar thumb printing experiment as described earlier. We took the thumb impressions of these volunteers before sanitization and at different time intervals (0, 30 and 60 min) after sanitization with either standard hand sanitizer (+ ve control) or PHS (Fig. 2b) . We observed that thumb prints taken immediately after sanitization did not show any microbial load for both standard and PHS ( Fig. 2b panels (ii, vi, x) ). However, colonies started getting visible in the prints taken after 30 min of sanitization. Visible comparison showed that these colonies were more numerous in the prints from thumbs sanitized with standard sanitizer (Fig. 2b panels (iii, vii, xi) ). The microbial load was within check even after 60 min of sanitization with PHS. But, thumb prints taken after 60 min of sanitization with standard sanitizer, showed quite an increase in microbial load (Fig. 2b panels (iv, viii,  xii) ). Taken together, these observations proved the prolonged retention of PHS on the surface it is applied and its consequent prolonged anti-microbial activity.",

At 0.02% v/v dilution, PHS inhibited 74.90 \u00b1 2.33% growth in S. epidermidis, while at same concentration the standard hand sanitizer exhibited 7.76 \u00b1 3.16% growth inhibition (Fig. 3a) . MIC 50 of PHS against S. epidermidis was 0.017% v/v while that of the standard sanitizer was 0.132% v/v (Fig. 3b) . Hill slope of 7.196 for PHS versus 6.716 for standard sanitizer clearly shows the remarkably improved anti-bacterial potency of the former. Likewise, at 0.04% v/v concentration, PHS inhibited 85.53 \u00b1 1.58% while the standard hand sanitizer inhibited 7.41 \u00b1 1.65% of S. aureus growth (Fig. 3c) . Calculated MIC 50 values for PHS and the standard sanitizer for S. aureus are 0.026% Fig. 3 Enhanced anti-bacterial potency of Patanjali Hand Sanitizer (PHS). a, c Grouped column graphs representing comparisons between % bacterial growth inhibition exhibited by the standard hand sanitizer (used as positive control) and PHS against S. epidermidis (a) and S. aureus (c). b, d Anti-bacterial potencies of the standard hand sanitizer (positive control) and PHS against S. epidermidis (b) and S. aureus (d) are represented as dose response curves along with the calculated MIC 50 values (concentrations at which either of the hand sanitizers is capable of 50% bacterial growth inhibition) and 3.664% v/v, respectively (Fig. 3d) . As with S. epidermidis, the hill slopes of 3.523 and 9.425 respectively for PHS and standard in case of S. aureus corroborate with the observation for S. epidermidis that anti-bacterial potentials of PHS are better than the standard hand sanitizer used for the study.",

This means our hands getting exposed to sanitizers more than ever and it is not restricted to clinical or laboratory set-ups only. This increases the likelihood of our skin cells experiencing prolonged exposure to chemicals foreign to them. Therefore, it is pertinent to ensure the cytosafety of the hand sanitizer we are using, which we ensured through standard alamer blue cell viability assay using human squamous epithelial skin cell line (A-431). We incubated the cells in different dilutions of standard sanitizer and PHS for either 2 min or 5 min before replacing the sanitizer exposure with regular growth medium for 24 h, when the cell viability was assessed. As expected, we did not observe any cytotoxic effect from standard sanitizer, nor did we find PHS to be toxic (Fig. 4a, b) . So, PHS was found to be equally safe as the standard hand sanitizer for skin the cells.",

PHS is comparable to the standard hand sanitizer in all respects with some added advantages.

The Aloe vera gel present in PHS makes it soothing for the skin and helps in moisturing the hands, and kind of doubles up as a hand moisturizer. Besides, A. vera is known for its anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties (Athiban et al. 2012; Rezazadeh et al. 2016) .",

The demand for the product has increased to such an extent that supermarkets and pharmaceutical stores have limited the number an individual can buy at a time. Currently, there is a huge gap in the demand-supply line of hand sanitizers in the world. Naturally, the prices of hand sanitizers have witnessed a surge across several international markets, due to its swelling demand. Several market players are actually deploying their manufacturing proficiency and amenities to address this shortfall; Dow Europe and Ineous, the leading polymer manufacturers, being one of them. In an attempt to cope with this scarcity, the Government of India has declared hand sanitizers, as one of the essential commodities, putting a cap on its price to discourage black marketing (https ://www.globe newsw ire.com/ news-relea se/2020/04/15/20161 41/0/en/Hand-Sanit izer-Marke t-To-Reach -USD-7-32-Billi on-By-2027-Repor ts-and-Data.html). Recently, to meet the surging demand for hand sanitizers, governments in many countries also adopted rationing of this product (https ://www.becke rshos pital revie w.com/quali ty/how-much-hand-sanit izeris-enoug h.html).",

The recommended frequency of hand sanitization, as laid down by various standard operating protocols from different health organizations and ministries, is once per hour under the current pandemic condition (https ://www.prude ntial unifo rms.com/blog/wait-often -sanit ize-hands /). Thus, nearly, 20 to 50 ml of hand sanitizer is required per person per day. However, a sanitizer that is retained longer on the hands after application is likely to provide protection from germs longer, in turn, reducing the consumption. This will automatically reduce the demand and help in relaxing the current strain on supply. Moreover, the standard hand sanitizer used in this study (and other similar sanitizers) cost around 600 to 700 INR for 500 ml, while, PHS costs around 120 INR for a similar pack size. Thus, taking the functional efficacy and the price together into consideration, PHS is ~ 4.3 times more cost effective than the standard hand sanitizer. This market analysis recognizes the commercial potentials of PHS, with a clear humanitarian vision of helping mankind during this pandemic, amidst a diminishing global economy.",
