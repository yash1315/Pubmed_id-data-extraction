Confirmation of MERS-CoV infection and molecular study on the virus may require transportation of samples to specialized laboratories. While freezing at -80\u00b0C is the gold standard method for RNA preservation, maintaining the integrity of viral RNA during transport will require additional precautions and, as a result, increase transport costs. We aimed at testing the stability of MERS-CoV RNA on spin columns of RNA extraction kit at room temperature for 16 weeks. Respiratory samples spiked with stock culture of MERS-CoV were extracted and loaded on QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit spin columns and preserved at room temperature. Amount of Viral RNA was evaluated periodically by realtime quantitative RT-PCR. Minimal changes in cycle threshold values over the study period was noted, suggesting stability of viral RNA by this preservation method. key words: MERS-CoV, coronavirus, RNA preservation, spin columns.

Cardona-Ospina et al. reviewed the use of FTA cards for the preservation of viral RNA at different temperatures and different processing methods for a variety of RNA viruses (although not including MERS-CoV) and showed a wide variation in the length of time the viral RNA could be maintained (Cardona-Ospina et al., 2019).Avian influenza virus RNA may be stored for up to 5 months at room temperature using FTA cards, while some arboviruses' (Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus) RNA may be successfully recovered from FTA cards after 28 days. Similarly, the RNASound card effectively maintained influenza virus RNA for about 28 days at room temperature(Lau and Hurt, 2016;  Hall-Mendelin et al., 2017).",
