            "text": "Objectives. To assess the influence of corticosteroid pulses on 60-day mortality in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Methods. We designed a multicenter retrospective cohort study in three teaching hospitals of Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Spain (865,096 people). We selected patients with confirmed COVID-19 and lung involvement with a pO2/FiO2<300, excluding those exposed to immunosuppressors before or during hospitalization, patients terminally ill at admission, or those who died in the first 24 hours. We performed a propensity score matching (PSM) adjusting covariates that modify the probability of being treated. Then, we used a Cox regression model in the PSM group to consider factors affecting mortality. Results. From 2933 patients, 257 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 124 patients were on corticosteroid pulses (250 mg of methylprednisolone for three days), and 133 were not. 30.3% (37/122) of patients died in the corticosteroid pulse group and 42.9% (57/133) in the nonexposed cohort. These differences (12.6%, 95% CI [8\u00b754-16.65]) were statically significant (log-rank 4.72, p = 0, 03). We performed PSM using the exact method. Mortality differences remained in the PSM group (log-rank 5.31, p = 0:021) and were still significant after a Cox regression model (HR for corticosteroid pulses 0.561; p = 0:039). Conclusions. This study provides evidence about treatment with corticosteroid pulses in severe COVID-19 that might significantly reduce mortality. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria with that selection process set a reliable frame to compare mortality in both the exposed and nonexposed groups.",

First, we analyzed variables associated with the propensity score in univariate analysis. Variables found significant were dichotomized, and then, we performed a binary logistic regression to evaluate independent variables associated with the propensity score. We chose three matching methods (propensity score matching) to preprocess the sample: the nearest neighbor, the nearest neighbor with a caliper (at a distance of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3), and exact matching. We performed the propensity score matching using the R software, with the MatchIt and Cobalt libraries.",

Thus, corticosteroid pulses might be a good option for the treatment of severe COVID-19, as they have been shown to be effective in reducing mortality in our cohort and they are inexpensive and highly available worldwide. Our results can only extrapolate to patients with severe COVID-19, with a pO2/FiO2 lower than 300, not exposed to any kind of immunosuppression, and in the absence of a terminally ill situation at admission. Some recent studies have confirmed that oral or intravenous low-dose corticosteroids positively affect mortality [29] . There was a decrease in mortality between 3.1 and 12.1% (in the ICU admitted group), lower than the 12.6% of global mortality reduction (even higher in the ICU subset) that we found. We hypothesized that the effect of cor-ticosteroid pulses might be higher than the low-dose corticosteroids because they act in different pathways (genomic vs. nongenomic) and behave, in fact, as different drugs [37] . Our study is not powered to compare both low-dose and pulse corticosteroid treatments, so we cannot assure this statement. Future studies must investigate this topic.",
