            "text": "Ovarian vein thrombosis is an uncommon condition. One report over multiple reviews found that the incidence of ovarian vein thrombosis is approximately 0.05% of vaginal deliveries and 1-2% of cesarean deliveries [1] . A more recent single-center study found the incidence to be even less: just 0.04% or 13 cases out of 40,353 postpartum patients [2] . Furthermore, approximately 90% of the ovarian vein thromboses (OVT) happen in the right ovarian vein [3] [4] . It has been reported predominantly in the postpartum state [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Traditionally, a postpartum or puerperal fever that does not respond to antibiotics should raise suspicion for OVT [6] . Other associated diseases include gynecologic malignancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and post-gynecologic surgery [3] . However, there is a reported case of OVT associated with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a pregnant woman [7] .",

However, some studies have postulated that patients with COVID-19 may have different coagulation abnormalities due to direct invasion of the endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) thereby leading to cellular injury. Other sources of endothelial injury also include mediators of acute systemic inflammatory response such as cytokines release [13] [14] . In COVID-19, changes in prothrombotic factors like D-dimer, fibrinogen, factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor have been reported to cause a hypercoagulable state. COVID-19 can also present as a critical illness. Critical illnesses have been associated with increased venous stasis due to the use of an intravenous catheter, immobilization, and mechanical ventilation. Since COVID-19 is associated with pro-inflammatory states (elevated C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase,) Abou-Ismail et al. proposed that the pathophysiology is centered around the cross-talk between inflammation and thrombosis which is a well-established relationship [9] .",
