T1DM represents one of the most frequent chronic illnesses in pediatric population and has shown a continuously increasing incidence over the last decades [1] . The most frequent clinical manifestations of T1DM are weight loss, polyuria, and polydipsia; therefore, the rapid recognition of these symptoms plays a key role in making an early diagnosis and thus avoiding the progression towards diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a life-threatening acute complication that can be associated with the onset of T1DM. The incidence of DKA varies widely from one geographic region to another, ranging from 15% to 70% in Europe and North America [2] .",

A multicentre study reported an 80% increase in new T1DM cases in children, some of these patients having a confirmed history of SARS-CoV-2 infection [7] . Several studies reported a significant increase in the frequency of DKA present at the diagnosis of T1DM, with a higher percentage of the severe form of this metabolic complication [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . It was hypothesized that an explanation for this phenomenon is the delay in the presentation of these patients caused by the parents' fear of accessing the healthcare system [9, 10] . However, reports from the United Kingdom showed a short duration of symptoms in the majority of children newly diagnosed with T1DM [7] . More information about the complex interactions between T1DM and COVID-19 was gathered due to a study which showed that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect cultured human pancreatic islets and replicate inside these cells, altering the subcellular morphology and the response to glycemic variations [13] . The pancreatic endocrine cells strongly express the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a main binding site for SARS-CoV-2 [14] .",

Vitamin D, due to its immunomodulatory properties, shows multiple beneficial effects in T1DM [15] . This idea is supported by a study reporting that 2000 UI cholecalciferol per day reduced T1DM incidence by 78% [16] . Moreover, the decision of the Finish authorities to fortify dietary milk products with vitamin D had led to a decrease in the number of T1DM cases [16] . From another point of view, the capacity of vitamin D to enhance the immune system might ensure a protective effect from developing severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce the risk of contracting the disease [17] .",

Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted for both outcomes. Patients' characteristics were included in multivariable analysis, regardless of their significance in univariable analysis, in order to estimate the independent effect of time of presentation on the outcomes. Furthermore, to address selection bias induced by the selection of patients in the pre-pandemic group, the analyses were repeated on a propensity score-matched dataset. Propensity scores for being diagnosed during or before the pandemic period were estimated with logistic regression, using all baseline measured characteristics. Patients were matched using 1:1 greedy nearest neighbor matching without replacement.

Regarding the presence of type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune diseases in the family medical history, two patients' mothers were diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis and one patient's cousin was diagnosed with T1DM. In half of these cases, the duration of T1DM characteristic symptoms (polyuria, polyphagia, weight loss) was 14 days; in two cases, it was 7 days; one patient had a 60 days history of the specific clinical manifestations, and one other patient presented no symptoms before the diagnosis. Among the eight patients, seven presented DKA which was mild in three cases, moderate in three, and severe in one patient. The HbA1c had a mean value of 12.19%, with a minimum of 10.70% and a maximum of 13.80%. The COVID-19 infection was completely asymptomatic in four of the children, one patient aged 2 presented fever (maximum temperature = 40 \u2022 C), eating refusal, and somnolence, two patients experienced vomiting, and abdominal pain (that could have been determined by SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as by DKA) and one patient was diagnosed with stomatitis and streptococcal pharyngitis. The presence of inflammation based on an increased level of C reactive protein was detected in five patients, with slightly elevated levels in three patients and a maximum value of 39.98 mg/dL in the patient that presented fever. Vitamin D deficiency was identified in two of the five measurements performed (Table 7 ). ",

In those first weeks of the pandemic, in our country a strict lockdown was imposed, with the population being allowed to leave the house only for a few clearly defined reasons like buying food and essential products, going to work in cases where the job was an essential one, and for mandatory medical assistance. Therefore, the lifestyle of children went through significant changes, one consequence being a significantly reduced exposure to common infectious microorganisms. Considering the potential of viral infections to act as triggers for the development of T1DM, the decreased incidence of this category of diseases might be an important cause of the lowered T1DM new cases at the beginning of the pandemic.",

Although the purpose of this analysis is effect estimation rather than prediction, weak [18] predictive performance might indicate that other important predictors of outcome exist, which we did not consider in our analysis.

In the matched cohort, the effect of presentation during the pandemic remained significantly associated with both higher likelihood of DKA at diagnosis and higher DKA severity. Another limitation is that the SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were not available for the new cases of T1DM. Additionally, the duration of symptoms might be insufficiently accurate as the information was gathered from the patients' parents or guardians. The main strength of this study, on the other hand, is represented by the large sample used: a relatively high number of patients were included in the analysis.

Between March and February 2020, in Bucharest (Romania) and the surrounding areas there was a 30.08% increase in the total number of new T1DM cases in children. The patients that presented during the pandemic had a lower mean age, higher values of HbA1c, and were living more frequently in a rural area compared to the previous years. The number of diabetic ketoacidosis presentations also showed an increase during the pandemic, patients diagnosed after March 2020 having a significantly higher risk of developing DKA, when adjusting for other predictors. Moreover, a higher percentage of children presented a severe form of this metabolic complication. In the subgroup of patients that presented with DKA, the time of diagnosis (i.e., during the pandemic) was the only variable that showed a significant association with increased severity. These findings are supporting the idea that an increase in the incidence and severity of T1DM in children could be one of the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic. The duration of T1DM symptoms did not differ significantly between the pandemic and the pre-pandemic group; therefore, a delay in the presentation is unlikely to have been the main cause of the increased number of DKA presentations. Among the patients with the T1DM onset during the pandemic, 8 of them also presented SARS-CoV2 infection at the time of diagnosis.",
