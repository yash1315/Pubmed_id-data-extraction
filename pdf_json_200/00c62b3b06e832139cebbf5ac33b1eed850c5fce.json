Due to these challenges, the care of several chronic conditions was in many cases discontinued and patients and healthcare professionals treating these conditions had to cope with this new scenario. This was the case of the world rare diseases (RDs) that had to face this global emergency despite the vulnerability of people with RDs and the well-known need for high expertise required to treat and manage them. The numerous lessons learned so far regarding health emergencies and RDs should represent the basis for the establishment of new healthcare policies and plans aimed at ensuring the preparedness of our health systems in providing appropriate care to people living with RDs in the case of eventual new emergencies. This paper aims at providing pragmatic considerations that might be useful in designing future actions to create or optimise existing organisational models for the care of RDs in case of future emergencies or any other situation that might threaten the provision of routine care. These policies and plans should benefit from the multi-stakeholder RDs networks (such as the European Reference Networks), that should join forces at European, national, and local levels to minimise the economic, organisational, and health-related impact and the negative effects of potential emergencies on the RDs community. In order to design and develop these policies and plans, a decalogue of points to consider were developed to ensure appropriate care for people living with RDs in the case of eventual future health emergencies.",

            "text": "Public health emergencies are usually defined in relation to the consequences they generate for the health of the population and to their precipitating events. When a situation has the potential of overwhelming health routine capabilities to address a specific condition, that situation can be considered as a public health emergency [1] , and this is exactly what has recently happened with the COVID-19 pandemic [2] . The COVID-19 disease is an infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus that was first identified at the beginning of 2020 in Wuhan, China. Due to the infectivity and the high contagion rate across the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. The main symptoms related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection are flu-like symptoms, severe lung injury, and, in high-risk individuals, the complications can include acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. As reported by the WHO, around 80% of cases are usually mild, while around 15% of people react severely and another 5% can become critically unwell. The unprecedented number of hospitalisations and often of intensive care beds, high-level of respiratory support, and personal protective equipment needed to provide appropriate care are only a few of the major difficulties that healthcare systems have experienced during the pandemic. The unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 had, in fact, significant repercussions on the healthcare systems, such as the need to reorganise the systems in order to concentrate resources needed to the care of COVID-19 patients and to respond to this health emergency. Due to these challenges, the care of several chronic conditions was in many cases discontinued and patients and healthcare professionals treating these conditions had to cope with this new scenario. Rare diseases (RDs) often impact patients and their families by limiting their activities and affect societies implying by healthcare costs, work loss, disability pensions, early retirement, and the increasing need for social support. In addition, they carry an important burden of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is easy to understand how COVID-19 had and has enormous repercussions on people living with rare diseases. The results of a recent survey [3] conducted by The European Organisation for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS) has provided a valuable overview of how the COVID-19 health emergency has impacted on RDs communities and highlighted that the main challenges were the interruption of care and of the rehabilitation therapies. More than 5000 rare disease patients and families from all over Europe have answered this survey during the pandemic (from 18 to 28 April 2020), providing important results and representing around 993 rare diseases. These results have reinforced the awareness that the vulnerability of people living with RDs requires from healthcare systems a growing commitment to increase their preparedness in the case of future health emergencies and to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to make sure that people living with RDs are not left behind [4] [5] [6] . This paper aims at providing pragmatic considerations that might be useful in designing future actions to create or optimise existing organisational models for the care of RDs in case of future emergencies or any other situation that might threaten the provision of routine care.",

Approximately 5000-8000 distinct RDs affect 6-8% of the EU population, which means between 27 and 36 million people and around 400 million people worldwide.

RD challenges are substantially different from the more common diseases and the major challenges are represented by the small number of patients and the consequent lack of knowledge about the many aspects of the diseases, such as the natural course and the cause of the diseases or the availability of targeted drugs for RDs. Moreover, due to their complexity and the risk of complications, they usually require a complex multidisciplinary approach that involves different experts from different disciplines. The scarce availability of expertise centres and of expert clinicians trained for the treatment and management of RDs do not allow the provision of a homogenous care and access to therapies for RD patients across the different countries.",

The ERNs were established in 2017 by the European Commission in the framework of the Directive 2011/24/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare. Currently, 24 ERNs are actively working with patient representative (the European Patients Advocacy Groups) on 24 groups of RDs, ranging from rare metabolic diseases to rare connective tissue diseases and rare tumours. ERNs are developing Clinical Practice Guidelines, patients' pathways, European-wide RD registries, and different educational activities (webinars, Masters, etc.) both for healthcare professionals and patients. In addition, ERNs are providing their expertise in virtual consultations thanks to the Clinical Patient Management System (CPMS), an on-line based, secure platform where clinicians and researchers across Europe convene to discuss RD clinical cases.",

            "text": "During the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare systems had to reorganise themselves in order to respond to this global pandemic at different levels. One of the main challenges was the reorganisation of care needed to care for COVID-19 patients and the consequent lack of resources in non-COVID-19 departments/units. Many of these departments/units were taking care of RDs patients and, in different cases, the majority of their activities were temporarily suspended to be dedicated to COVID-19 care, due to the fact that many healthcare professionals had to serve in the COVID units and therefore those units were not always able to provide full care to their RDs patients. This resulted, in many cases, in a discontinuation, interruption or delay of care for RDs patients, and in the need to reorganize the patients' flow for in-and out-patient clinics and of the related protocols as soon as the emergency decreased in severity to protect patients from the risk of infection as well as to respect the social/physical distancing rules. During the emergency, many RDs patients were not able to access to their healthcare provider, many of them could not perform the monitoring exams needed for their disease, or could not complete their diagnosis pathway, or, sometimes, the needed interventions (surgical or treatment-based) could not be organised. The implications of these limitations will have to be assessed once the health emergency will be resolved, but it is possible to hypothesize that the possible results of the discontinuation of care might include exacerbation of the disease activity, delay in diagnosis and treatment with potential accrual of organ damage, and a lack of prevention protocols. That is not to mention the psychological implications that the discontinuation of care might have had on patients, including depression, worsening of the symptoms, anxiety, isolation, fear of contracting the virus in hospitals, etc.",

Overall, the sudden spread of the use of telemedicine and eHealth has demonstrated that it is actually possible to use this kind of tool in appropriate situations. However, it has also showed that both patients and healthcare providers are not yet fully prepared or equipped to adopt these solutions and that there is a high need to provide harmonised, user-friendly, and sustainable eHealth and telemedicine tools.",

Recently, a cross-sectional study from China tried to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the RDs population in Hong Kong, a region with the highest number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in China outside of Hubei [7] . The study was conducted between 10 April and 29 April 2020, around 2-4 weeks after the establishment of the public gathering restrictions in Hong Kong; patients with RDs or their caregivers were recruited online through Rare Disease Hong Kong (RDHK), a big RD patient group, and other online social media platforms on a strictly voluntary basis. A structured online quantitative survey comprising of 37 questions was distributed to the participants through internet-based sources. The survey included questions regarding the patient's demographic characteristics, health status, service use patterns, reasons for reduced service use, daily living and social life, and financial status from the patient or caregiver perspective. Participants were also asked to complete the Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living (ADL) for the patient, which measures a person's ability to perform ten basic activities of daily living and provides a quantitative estimate of the subject's level of dependence. The study collected a total of 272 responses, of which 63% was from RDs patients and 38% from caregivers of patients with RDs. Even if there were no reported COVID-19 cases in the study population, the majority of patients claimed that the care was highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the results of the study clearly demonstrated the patient's and caregivers' perception of the pandemic's impact on RDs patient's health and social well-being in two different dimensions: the effect brought by the closure/disruption of the public healthcare services and the perceived risk of infection. These considerations highlight how important it is to assess the impact of this pandemic in the RDs population, since we can easily imagine that all the people around the world felt more vulnerable, but RDs patients were definitely even more vulnerable than usual.",
