            "text": "Objectives The present study aimed to improve breast cancer (BC) awareness and practices using Information, Education and Communication (IEC) modules and health educational sessions for women and primary healthcare providers in low socioeconomic community of Mumbai. Design Pre-post quasi-experimental design. Setting The study was conducted in a lower socioeconomic area of G-South ward of Mumbai, Maharashtra. The baseline and endline survey was conducted using structured interview schedules. Participants 410 women were selected, aged between 18 and 55 years who were not pregnant, lactating or diagnosed with BC. Intervention A health education-based intervention module was developed to educate women through group and individual sessions. Outcomes Summative indices were constructed to understand the net mean difference in knowledge of signs, symptoms and risk factors. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-test were used to check the significant improvement of intervention. Results Our results showed statistical significance in difference in mean knowledge scores for both signs and symptoms (mean difference (MD) 4.09, SD 4.05, p<0.00)) and risk factors of BC knowledge (MD 5.64, SD 4.00, p<0.00) among women after intervention. There was a marked improvement in the knowledge of BC among women with low education category. A significant improvement in knowledge of symptoms and risk factors among health workers was also observed. Our interventions resulted in positive change in breast examination practices. The breast self-examination (BSE) practices improved from around 3% to 65% and around 41% additional women went for clinical breast examination after intervention. Conclusions This study found a significant improvement in knowledge of BC signs and symptoms, risk factors and BSE practices among study participants following our health education interventions among these subpopulations. This evidence calls for inclusion of similar interventions through health education and capacity building of primary healthcare providers in national programmes.",

The last few decades saw a rapid surge in breast cancer (BC) cases, making it the leading cancer among women in India. 4 Although Indian women are less prone to BC than the women from Western countries, the mortality rate among them is very high compared with women from Western countries. 3 5 6 As per National Cancer Registry Programme of India and GLOBOCAN 2018, the mortality rate in India (17.1 per 100 000 women) was more than that in the UK (12.7 per 100 000 women) despite the low incidence rate of BC. 7 This high mortality is attributed to late detection of the BC at locally advanced or metastatic stages. Several studies showed that in Western countries, majority of BC cases were reported in stage I or II of the disease, whereas in India, around 46% of these were reported in advanced stages. 6 8 9 The importance of early diagnosis has been highlighted by most researchers as a pathway to save life and it acts as an important method to improve the medical condition. [10] [11] [12] [13] This scenario of late diagnosis arose due to different factors such as non-existence of high quality primary level screening programmes, lack of regional treatment centres, overdependence on large tertiary cancer hospitals, high out-ofpocket expenditure and non-participation of women in existing programmes. 5 13-17 Studies have found that the awareness about different signs and symptoms and risk factors of BC among women in India is low, contributing to late detection of BCs among them. 13 [18] [19] [20] The Government of India launched National Programme for Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke in 2010 as an umbrella programme for non-communicable diseases in selected 100 districts. 2 The programme aimed to provide community-based cost-effective screening of men and women above 30 years of age for all high burden cancers including BC through a checklist collected by village health workers like ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists). As a part of this programme, women were asked and screened for lumps in breast, bloody discharge from the nipple and change in shape and size of the breast. But this screening is conducted for a woman in 5-year duration. The ASHAs were advised to refer all suspected cases to the nearest available facility. However, this remains a challenge due to lack of trained human resources and limited training modalities.",

            "text": "The rapid rise in number of BC cases has been associated with growing urbanisation and rapid lifestyle changes. 21 Many studies have found that women living in urban India were more vulnerable to BC than those from rural areas, 22 23 with highest incidence rate in major metropolitan cities. 24 As per the latest available statistics, the ageadjusted incidence rate of BC was high in urban hubs like Hyderabad district (48 per 100 000 women) followed by Chennai (42.2), Bangalore (40.5), Delhi (38.6), Patiala (36.9), Thiruvananthapuram (35.6), Mumbai (34.4) and Bhopal (32.6) . 24 In the last few decades, India's transformative neoliberal economic reform and development have brought a large chunk of population to bigger cities from rural areas in expectation of gainful employment in industries and services sectors. Although the echelon of privileged urban Indians have better access to knowledge and high quality of services about cancer care through private and specialised tertiary care facilities, the low socioeconomic stratum has low access to primary screening or biomedical oncological expertise. 25 26 The existing social cleavages in access and quality of cancer care among poor and non-poor in urban India is more acute due to the existing socioeconomic and health system blockades. 26 The processes and pathways of accessing care are many a time confusing to common citizens as at the initial stage of cancer they generally prefer to go to a local untrained physician, pharmacist or quack, who often do not recognise the malignancy. 26 Moreover, widespread public misunderstanding, extremely limited awareness in understanding of cancer symptoms, prevention, treatment, existing social stigma and structural inequalities across sociocultural groups pose as barriers to early detection. 13 26 Many studies in India found that the knowledge of BC risk factors was low. 13 For example, some studies found that the awareness levels of risk factors related to age at menarche and menopause among women was limited between 1% and 28%. 19 27-29 Age at menarche and menopause is considered as two strongest risk factors of BC. 13 A review by Gupta et al 13 suggested that the awareness of different risk factors such as overweight and obesity (11%-51%), family history (13%-58%), age at birth of first child (8%-83%), lack of breast feeding (17%-88%) and tobacco smoking (20%-74%) varied widely across different locations and age groups of women in India. 13 16 28-31 Studies have found literacy deficit about BC among health professionals at primary care centres, nurses and other health staffs as a potential barrier in BC prevention and early detection as they are on the frontline for spreading awareness at the community level. 13 32 Hence, capacity building of both primary healthcare providers and community education are essential to increase awareness about BC, promoting screening, early detection and treatment of BC cases.",

To the best of our knowledge, there is no study from Mumbai that focused on such intervention. Further, very few studies focused on capacity building of primary health facilities or community health workers for a better and sustainable health intervention for BC screening at the primary care level. 29 36 Therefore, the present study aimed to improve BC awareness and practices among Open access women using BC Information, Education and Communication (IEC) modules and health educational sessions for women and primary healthcare providers using a health system approach in low socioeconomic community of Mumbai. We focused on capacity building of staff of the primary health facility, provided training sessions at the facilities and identified the barriers in implementing clinical breast examination (CBE) practices at primary care level.",

The baseline tool covered questions on sociodemographic characteristics of women, awareness, signs, symptoms and risk factors of BC. The tool also covered questions on BSE and CBE practices. Women were asked about their awareness of BC and those who were aware were asked in detail about their knowledge of BC signs and symptoms, risk factors and current practices using closed-response questions. The questionnaire was prepared using available literature, and a team of experts which consisting of oncologist, gynaecologist, public health specialist and social scientist was consulted. The questions were translated to local languages, that is, Marathi and Hindi, for the convenience of the participants. These questions were pretested with 20 participants (10 questionnaires each for Hindi and Marathi) at a similar socioeconomic setting in Mumbai. The results from this pilot testing were used to modify the words for easy comprehension of the participants. The endline survey included similar questions on knowledge and practices of BC and reasons for not conducting BSE and CBE.

Only half of the women were Open access aware about BC before the interventions. After interventions, all the participants were aware of it. Our health education interventions were grounded in behavioural change theories, practical community-based adult education training modules and BSE practices, which lead to strengthening of perceived susceptibility to BC and breaking the perceived barriers through knowledge enhancement. The post-intervention results revealed statistically significant improvement in mean knowledge scores of different signs and symptoms and risk factors among women in the study area. Similar targeted education-based intervention studies in different settings of India and elsewhere found increase in BC knowledge and awareness among the study population. 10 33-36 38-40 A similar intervention study using flipchart and video slides on Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) in an Urban Health Centers of Ahmedabad found that group session of 20-25 subjects, in each session, resulted in statistical significant impact on knowledge of screening methods before and after health education interventions. 29 The study in semiurban Madhya Pradesh and rural Tamil Nadu found that health education interventions for women led to improved knowledge and BC screening practices among the participants. 33 35 Interestingly, studies in Iran and urban slums of Egypt also observed dramatic improvement in participants' knowledge about BC following health education interventions among women with low level education. 10 38 Two studies on college-going students in India and New York city also found similar results. 39 40 Our baseline survey results revealed that the knowledge of risk factors was very low among women. 19 A very low percentage of women considered menstruation at an early age (3%), late menopause (5%) and first baby after 30 years (8%) as important risk factors before the interventions.

Our analysis shows that there was improvement across all educational groups but marked improvement was observed among low education categories of women. The results of ANOVA showed statistically significant net difference (p<0.01) in mean score before and after interventions.

Our intervention sessions conducted by experts from TMC, Mumbai, found statistically significant difference in mean knowledge score of signs and symptoms and risk factors among the healthcare workers at the municipal maternity home. The community workers had very good interaction with the women in local community Open access and they provided pamphlets to spread awareness in the community. Our interventions resulted in positive change in breast examination practices. The BSE practices improved from around 3%-65% and around 41% additional women went for CBE after intervention. Although efficiency of BSE remains debatable, it is a cost-effective and noninvasive tool for women who wish to perform monthly BSE to recognise early signs of abnormal breast changes if any. 42 Similar interventional studies in India and Iran observed improvement in BC practices among the participants of the studies. 10 29 33 35 Our findings suggest that to improve BC knowledge and capacity building of healthcare providers in primary health centres under government, health programmes such interventions are needed at the grassroot level for screening and early detection of BC.",

Although our findings are confined to low socioeconomic areas of Mumbai, but available pieces of evidence call for inclusion of similar interventions through capacity building of primary healthcare providers under national programmes. In the present scenario, findings from our study necessitate for community empowerment through capacity building of available primary and community level healthcare providers for better understanding of aetiology of BC and improved BSE practices. National programmes may use effective media platforms like television and IEC at the primary healthcare facilities to improve BC awareness and BSE practices.",

It was difficult for some of the participants to attend the training sessions at the facilities as they were engaged in a job or childcare. We provided in-house sessions for them. Primary health centres run with limited human resources, thereby putting extra burden on them. For example, one of the health facility had on one male doctor who could not be trained for CBE at TMC due to burden of work on him. We also found that some women were uncomfortable in talking to a male doctor. In addition to the operational issues, this was a quasi-experiment pre-post study with one limited session intervention and the results were Figure 4 Breast self-examination practices after intervention among the female participants. Those who were practising BSE were asked how often they are practising. Once in 3 months means at least once in 3 months but not regularly in every month. Once in 6 months means not regularly but rarely in the last 4-6 months. The reasons were given for those who are not practising breast self-examination.",
