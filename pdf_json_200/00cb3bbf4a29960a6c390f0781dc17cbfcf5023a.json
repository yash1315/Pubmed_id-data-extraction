The obtained forecasts are promising and can be helpful for policymakers coping with the threats of COVID-19.",

However, most of the models have a limited scope of forecasts for a particular country or region only. Previous researches [8, 9] have also used LSTM models to forecast but they use old data E-mail address: 073bme648@pcampus.edu.np. of the same country which is pretty limited. As it may not have seen and learned from the various patterns like sharp spikes and flattening effects, the learning process may be incomplete and imprecise. These dynamic patterns are more prevalent in early infected countries like Italy which have now passed the sharp spiking and gradual flattening for new cases. The use of Transfer Learning may help the network to model all these highly nonlinear temporal patterns which the test country may have never seen in its history. For countries like France, Italy the earlier occurrence and spread provides a large dataset for training which is not available for countries that saw the spread later like India and Nepal, which imposed strict lockdown early but is easing the regulations now. This discrepancy in pandemic over various regions has provided mature data for earlier infected countries.",

However, the problems of exploding and vanishing gradient are more common in simple RNN [13] . LSTM solves this problem by introducing a new memory state in RNN [14] . The ability of LSTM networks to capture patterns in data like trends, seasonality, autocorrelations and noise makes it a good candidate for the time series forecast. In a deep neural network, initial layers capture more basic features or patterns and the deeper layer can extract high-level features. As a model trained in one country is used to forecast for the next country, the network should learn basic temporal patterns and avoid memorizing high-level features of a particular dataset. For this single layer LSTM network has been used to avoid any deep and complex architecture. For single and 5-days predictions 1 and 5 units are assigned for this singlelayered network. The network does not return any sequences so the output from the LSTM network is the final output. The use of any dense layer has been avoided.",

During training, the network learns respective weights by trying to minimize the error between the actual value on the 9th day and the forecasted value by the network. For 5 days multistep prediction window size of 20 is used i.e. 20 days of past data is input for the network and the consecutive future 5 days data is used as output for the network. The time sequence is maintained both for input and output. A larger window size is used for multistep prediction as more data sequence is necessary to forecast the long-range pattern. Fig. 1 depicts the architecture for single day prediction, as the window size is eight, the unit has eight cells. Each cell receives sequential input however the output is received from the final cell which is a typical many-to-one architecture. In multistep prediction 5 such sequences as in Fig. 1 are used with 20 cells in each unit. For a particular unit, the weights of trainable parameters across all the cells remain the same. In this architecture, the single-step model has 12 trainable parameters whereas the 5 days prediction model has 140 trainable parameters.",

In contrast, gradual descent is clear for new death cases in the United States data. Because of this United States' training data for new death cases can capture a wider range of patterns than the data for new cases which still have no signs of the descent part.

The strategies implemented in European countries were pretty similar to each other [18] , so the Italy model predicts better for European countries whereas for Brazil the strategy was very different from that of Italy and the US as well so the forecasts have higher errors. However, for Countries like Nepal and India where there are a lot of differences in intervention strategy, the health care system, and other control policies Italy model performs just as well as it performed for the European countries. This shows the forecasted values are also a strong function of its history or past data regardless of the exact policies being implemented or the other diversifying factors.",

These forecasts have verified that even for different modes of intervention, policies, and health care systems, the proposed models can predict well. The results indicate new cases and deaths can be forecasted pretty well with the proposed models. Complex patterns of steep rise, spikes, and flattening effects of new cases and deaths can be learned from mature datasets i.e. data from countries infected earlier. This approach is more useful for countries that are in its early phase of virus spread, to forecast based on other country's models.
