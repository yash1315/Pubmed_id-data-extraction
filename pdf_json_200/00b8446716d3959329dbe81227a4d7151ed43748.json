            "text": "African American women with breast cancer generally rely on their spirituality to cope with psychosocial issues encountered during survivorship. However, in order to mitigate the risk of contracting COVID-19, a potentially deadly disease, it is imperative that community-dwelling older adults physically distance themselves from supportive family, friends, and even traditional faithbased activities. In this report, we explore the ways in which spirituality was used to manage stressors during this pandemic. This is a qualitative descriptive study with content analysis of data from the narratives from 18 African American breast cancer survivors. Participants were interviewed via phone and video conferencing platform and asked to respond to questions of strategies used to manage stressors encountered during this COVID-19 pandemic. Spirituality enabled African American breast cancer survivors to better manage their psychological distress through (1) increased engagement in religious activities; (2) reliance on God for protection when fearful, feeling isolated, and in need of assistance to pay household bills; (3) finding joy and courage from listening to gospel music and reading scripture; and (4) finding meaning through spirituality. These findings suggest that in spite of physical distancing requirements that impose limited access to faith-based institutions during this COVID-19 pandemic, spirituality continues to be a supportive resource to manage emotional stressors.",

African American women diagnosed with breast cancer continue to have the highest mortality rates as well as the second highest incidence rates [1] . In fact, the cancer death rate for non-Hispanic African American women is 41% higher than non-Hispanic white women. Although the mortality rates for breast cancer have been declining, a racial disparity persists for African American women [1] . Financial difficulties, lack of provider sensitivity, and an absence of family support are among those major patient concerns that contribute to this racial disparity in breast cancer. African American women with breast cancer are now faced with being in the category of individuals at a higher risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19 [2, 3] . In comparison to other racial/ethnic groups, African Americans are nearly four times as likely to die from COVID-19 [2] . In addition, comorbidities such as heart disease, asthma, obesity, and diabetes are prevalent among African American breast cancer patients so that if COVID-19 is contracted, the outcome is likely to result in death [4, 5] .",

Older African Americans in particular were more likely to transmit stories of \"making it through\" times of oppression and serious illness that incorporate their strong religious culture [18] [19] [20] . Historically, the use of religious songs and Bible verses as expressions of spirituality were memorized and transmitted orally as a strategy that has given African Americans meaning to their human existence [21] . Biblical text and lyrics of religious songs, for example, were used frequently among African slaves to provide insight into their belief systems as well as their connectedness to God and to other individuals who were suffering and powerless [18] [19] [20] . Moreover, among African Americans, Biblical text was a source for stories that allowed transcendence from a current situation of suffering to some other place or time. A reliance on spirituality further helped African Americans to view the relief of pain and sorrow of other faithful servants as evidence of God's ability to protect, strengthen, and heal [18, 22] .",

This finding is consistent with other reports of African Americans adapting to their needs for spiritual support via churches through on-line and social media formats during this pandemic [23] . However, since not all churches have resources for an on-line format, benefits such as fellowship with congregants and support and encouragement from this interaction are missing [24] . Although the response of increased religious activities during stressful life events is not novel, the benefit from the availability of worship services from local churches through social media during extended periods isolation even after the pandemic ends should be further explored.",

This response of relying on God to cope with fear, social isolation, and to provide for food and shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic brings to our attention to a function of spirituality not emphasized in literature during this pandemic. The closure of churches and requirements for physical distancing has led to feelings of social isolation and loneliness that has been stressful for many African Americans [23] . An increasing reliance on connectedness through phone and social media fills the void for social interactions for some but not all. The findings from previous research suggest that a lack of meaningful social interactions adversely affects one's mental and physical health; however, the short-and long-term effects from physical distancing imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic are unclear. Additionally, African Americans have been especially impacted by financial hardships such as the loss of income. This financial hardship is apparent in the long lines of cars showing up at food banks, the individuals in jeopardy of being evicted from their homes, and the increased loss of health insurance that accompanies unemployment.",

This time of reflection resulted in a refocus on individual life goals, reconnection with old friends by phone or social media, or even engagement in life-long learning opportunities through attendance in available online courses. These participants recalled previous plagues from the Bible, God's purpose for calamities, ways in which individuals survived those times through being obedient. Similarly, survivorship of the COVID-19 pandemic is possible through adhering to the mandates for physical distancing.",

African American women who are survivors of breast cancer are especially at high risk for not only contracting but also dying from this virus. African American women generally rely on their spirituality to cope with psychosocial issues encountered during cancer survivorship; however, the findings from this study suggest that spirituality continues to be an important strategy in spite of physical distancing and church closures. These breast cancer survivors were more engaged in religious practices, relying on God for protection, finding joy and courage through religious songs and reading Biblical text, and finding purpose in their lives during this pandemic. Educational efforts should target health care providers to assist their cancer patients to think of alternative ways to meet their needs for spiritual support during this pandemic. For example, cancer patients might be encouraged to locate on-line worship services or to reflect on other historical and Biblical plagues that required physical distancing. Secondly, health care practitioners might encourage cancer patients to sing, hum, or recite the lyrics of a favorite song or Biblical text when anxious or worried. Finally, cancer survivors find meaning and purpose in \"giving back\" through supporting other cancer patients. Health care practitioners might encourage the cancer survivor to redirect goals to those that can be accomplished during this time of physical distancing and limited access to traditional faith-based activities. These efforts are likely to enable the cancer survivor to overcome social isolation and loneliness that frequently leads to high levels of stress and poor mental health outcomes.",
