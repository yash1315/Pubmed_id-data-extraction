The test most frequently recommended was the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays (80 recommendations), followed by chest CT (31 recommendations) , and chest US (21 recommendations). The test was not described or was unclearly reported in 28 recommendations (i.e. \"COVID testing\", \"laboratory testing\"). In addition, 78 recommendations reported tests for the investigation of other diagnoses, monitoring of disease and assessment of severity, such as blood counts, biomarkers, cultures and kidney and liver functions, among others. 13 the use chest CT and chest x-rays for grading severity. There was also consensus about when to repeat RT-PCR in cases of high suspicion of infection and negative findings, the collection of lower respiratory specimens to confirm an initial undetermined diagnosis, and the co-assessment for other respiratory pathogens.",

We mostly relied on the search of guideline repositories, documents linked to scientific societies and publications in indexed journals to inform this scoping review. We considered that this strategy would identify documents with greater support given by experts and professional societies. Despite we conducted a specific search of guidance developed by experts based on the 30 countries more affected by the pandemic, it is possible that some such guidelines could be missing.

However, the currently available VTM-swab systems are often designed for one swab. Therefore, specimen packaging and shipping should be conducted carefully, as there is a risk of leakage during transportation. When collecting only one specimen, a nasopharyngeal swab is recommended first. It may be necessary to collect lower respiratory tract specimens, such as sputum; however, sputum induction is not indicated.",

Appropriate scenarios for use of COVID-19 Ag-RDTs include the following: ii) To support outbreak investigations (e.g. in closed or semi-closed groups including schools, care-homes, cruise ships, prisons, work-places and dormitories, etc.) In NAAT-confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks, Ag-RDTs could be used to screen at-risk individuals and rapidly isolate positive cases (and initiate other contact tracing efforts) and prioritize sample collection from RDT-negative individuals for NAAT. 226 (118) 2. Appropriate scenarios for use of COVID-19 Ag-RDTs include the following: v) Testing of asymptomatic contacts of cases may be considered even if the Ag-RDT is not specifically authorized for this use, since asymptomatic cases have been demonstrated to have viral loads similar to symptomatic cases (17), though in that situation, a negative Ag-RDT should not remove a contact from quarantine requirements. 164 (111) For asymptomatic contacts of patients with COVID-19, WHO suggests not using chest imaging for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (Conditional recommendation, based on expert opinion) 255 (120) Rapid antigen tests perform best when the person is tested in the early stages of infection with SARS-CoV-2 when viral load is generally highest. They also may be informative in diagnostic testing situations in which the person has a known exposure to a con rmed case of COVID-19.",

However, the currently available VTM-swab systems are often designed for one swab. Therefore, specimen packaging and shipping should be conducted carefully, as there is a risk of leakage during transportation. When collecting only one specimen, a nasopharyngeal swab is recommended first. It may be necessary to collect lower respiratory tract specimens, such as sputum; however, sputum induction is not indicated. Appropriate scenarios for use of COVID-19 Ag-RDTs include the following: iv) Where there is widespread community transmission, RDTs may be used for early detection and isolation of positive cases in health facilities, COVID-19 testing centres/sites, care homes, prisons, schools, front-line and health-care workers and for contact tracing. Note that the safe management of patients with RDT-negative samples will depend on the RDT performance and the community prevalence of COVID-19 (see Annex). A negative Ag-RDT result cannot completely exclude an active COVID-19 infection, and, therefore, repeat testing or preferably confirmatory testing (NAAT) should be performed whenever possible ( Figure  1) , particularly in symptomatic patients.",

For commercial assays, interpretation of results should be done according to the instructions for use.

In patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection, we suggest that a nasopharyngeal specimen be obtained first. In the setting of severe or progressive disease requiring intubation, if additional specimen is needed to establish a diagnosis of COVID-19 or other diagnosis that will change clinical management, lower respiratory specimens from endotracheal aspirate or bronchoscopy with Q11 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be performed (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). 113 (95) Chest CT is the most valuable imaging tool for the clinical diagnosis of early stage COVID-19 pneumonia when patients' symptoms are aspecific, especially in Wuhan with insufficient PCR tests in the early pandemic period 113 (95) Chest X-ray examination is convenient and fast, and has been proven effective in diagnosing other coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [23] [24] [25] [26] . However, the sensitivity and specificity for mild type patients are relatively low [27] . It is not recommended for patients with early COVID-19 stage. 113 (95) It is recommended to use volume CT with a maximum acquisition slice thickness of 5 mm (\u226516 slice multi-detector CT) and a reconstruction slice thickness of 1.0 to 1.5 mm [30] . Multi-planar reformats (transverse, sagittal, and coronal planes) are beneficial for the early detection of lesions in patients with negative nucleic acid tests [9] . 114 (96) If bronchoscopy is performed for diagnostic reason, tracheobronchial lavage using a few milliliters or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) only is recommended. No other diagnostic procedures such as transbronchial biopsy or needle aspiration should be performed in the same procedure. 114 (96) The indication for bronchoscopy in the case of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 disease should be made very strict and should only be considered if: Diagnostic reason: the nasopharyngeal smear is negative two times and clinically there is still diagnostic uncertainty of COVID-19 infection. 123 (100) Broncofibroscop\u00eda: este procedimiento genera una gran cantidad de aerosoles por lo que se debe restringir su realizaci\u00f3n, en caso de necesidad debe realizarse s\u00f3lo en pacientes con intubaci\u00f3n endotraqueal.

For these kits, the confirmatory test result is deemed positive only if both confirmatory genes are detected. If one gene is not detected, the result cannot be interpreted as positive. 48 (85) As of March 11, 2020, KSLM and the KCDC recommend a positive result determination only when all the genes are detected, even for tests using different genes from those mentioned in the above two guidelines. This recommendation is based on the opinions of numerous experts who observed nonspecific and weak amplification in the clinical specimens of patients who received final results of COVID-19 as negative. 48 (85) As the current knowledge on COVID-19 is limited, it is difficult to rule out infection based on a single negative test result, especially when the test is performed using an upper respiratory tract specimen. Even if the upper respiratory tract specimen tests negative, the collection and testing of lower respiratory tract specimens are strongly recommended, especially in cases of severe or progressive disease 48 (85) COVID-19 real-time RT-PCR may be performed for the purposes of: Confirming cases of suspected COVID-19 48 (85) COVID-19 real-time RT-PCR may be performed for the purposes of: Differential diagnosis of cases with unknown respiratory syndromes 48 (85) Criteria for final test interpretation: All kits currently available in Korea can detect two or more genes. According to the interpretation criteria of some manufacturers, detection of only one of multiple genes is interpreted as COVID-19 positive. However, based on results from actual clinical specimens, KSLM recommends a determination of a positive result only when all genes are detected. When only one gene is detected, retesting or consulting the reference laboratory is recommended. 48 (85) If a patient with an epidemiological correlation and COVID-19 symptoms repeatedly tests negative, the tested specimen should be submitted to the KCDC for further testing. 48 (85) If the upper respiratory tract specimens test negative, lower respiratory tract specimens should be collected and tested. 48 (85) Patient specimens, a positive control, and a negative control should be examined together, and internal controls should be examined and verified together in all reactions.

As the clinical significance of coinfection caused by the causative agent of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases remains unclear, the collection of a sufficient quantity of clinical specimens with proper methods is recommended. 48 (85) Specimen selection/ Patients referred for additional testing by a physician (e.g., patients who tested negative using nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, but show an indication of pneumonia): Lower respiratory tract specimens, such as sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and tracheal aspirates, should be collected. 48 (85) Specimen selection/Patients with severe symptoms, patients with a productive cough, and intubated patients: Lower respiratory tract specimens, such as sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and tracheal aspirates, should be collected. If possible, the collection of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be considered. 48 (85) The collection of specimens for diagnosis is recommended within seven days of symptom onset. 84 (88) Novel coronavirus nucleic acid can be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, feces and other specimens using RT-PCR and/or NGS methods. It is more accurate if specimens are obtained from lower respiratory tract (sputum or air tract extraction). The specimens should be submitted for testing as soon as possible after collection 88 (89) En el caso de que se determine que se cumplen los criterios de realizaci\u00f3n de test diagn\u00f3stico para la detecci\u00f3n de infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2 es necesaria la toma de las siguientes muestras: -Tracto respiratorio superior: exudado nasofar\u00edngeo/orofar\u00edngeo. o -Tracto respiratorio inferior: esputo (si es posible) o aspirado endotraqueal, lavado broncoalveolar, o broncoaspirado, especialmente en pacientes con enfermedad respiratoria grave. 88 (89) La indicaci\u00f3n de TC tor\u00e1cico debe individualizarse. La realizaci\u00f3n de TC t\u00f3rax de baja dosis para la detecci\u00f3n de infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2 puede valorarse, especialmente en las \u00e1reas geogr\u00e1ficas m\u00e1s afectadas por el COVID-19, y para pacientes con radiograf\u00eda de t\u00f3rax normal con elevada sospechosa cl\u00ednica. 88 (89) Si al paciente es preciso realizarle una radiograf\u00eda de t\u00f3rax (con proyecciones postero-anterior y lateral) se utilizar\u00e1 un aparato port\u00e1til para evitar traslados. El aparato deber\u00e1 estar protegido por pl\u00e1sticos desechables y lavado posteriormente con una soluci\u00f3n de hipoclorito de sodio al 1% o del desinfectante aprobado para superficies en su centro. 88 (89) Si las pruebas iniciales son negativas en un paciente con una alta sospecha cl\u00ednica y epidemiol\u00f3gica (especialmente cuando solo se han recogido muestras de tracto respiratorio superior o la muestra recogida inicialmente no estaba tomada adecuadamente) se repetir\u00e1 el diagn\u00f3stico con nuevas muestras del tracto respiratorio. 88 (89) Tras la confirmaci\u00f3n del caso se enviar\u00e1n tambi\u00e9n las siguientes muestras: Dos muestras de suero: la serolog\u00eda es \u00fatil para la confirmaci\u00f3n de la respuesta a la infecci\u00f3n por coronavirus. La primera muestra debe recogerse durante la primera semana del cuadro cl\u00ednico (fase aguda) y la segunda muestra entre 14- 30 (101) Diagn\u00f3sticos consignados en COVID-19: a) Diagn\u00f3stico cl\u00ednico: El cuadro cl\u00ednico m\u00e1s frecuente est\u00e1 caracterizado por un s\u00edndrome gripal, que inicia con fiebre leve, con evoluci\u00f3n progresiva de la temperatura, y persistencia entre 3 a 4 d\u00edas, con un posterior descenso, como ha sido observado en casos de influenza9. El diagn\u00f3stico depende de la evaluaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica-epidemiol\u00f3gica y del examen f\u00edsico. Se recomienda que en todos los casos con s\u00edndrome gripal se pregunte por el antecedente de viaje en el interior y exterior del pa\u00eds, as\u00ed como contacto cercano con personas que haya viajado, dentro de los 14 d\u00edas antes del inicio de s\u00edntomas. Esta informaci\u00f3n debe escribirse en la historia cl\u00ednica para una eventual investigaci\u00f3n epidemiol\u00f3gica. 125 (101) The Panel recommends that a molecular or antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 should be used to diagnose acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (AIII). 222 (80) Collect specimens for COVID-19 testing as recommended by your local or provincial public health laboratory. 222 (80) SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are not recommended for diagnosis of current SARS-CoV-2infection, but they may be useful in post-infectious syndromes. 231 (104) A single positive PCR test is sufficient proof of COVID-19 infection. Repeat \"confirmatory\" PCR testing on asymptomatic patients who test positive is not indicated, as PCR-based tests have excellent specificity, and asymptomatic and presymptomatic COVID-19 patients are now well described26. 231 (104) Clinical specimens should be collected as soon as possible after onset of symptoms, ideally within 7 days. If a patient presents \u22657 days from symptom onset and is still symptomatic, respiratory samples should be collected.",

Specimens should be collected and transported urgently (same day as collection) for SARS-CoV-2 testing. 231 (104) If a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 persists despite an initial negative test, repeat testing should be considered in consultation with an infectious diseases expert, particularly in hospitalised patients for whom management might be significantly altered. However, it is equally important to maintain a broad differential diagnosis and to always consider alternative diagnoses26. 231 (104) Lower respiratory tract samples are the preferred specimen type because the lower respiratory tract is the primary site of infection and they are likely to contain the highest viral loads (based on experience with MERS-CoV) and therefore have a better yield. For severe cases, collection of both lower and upper airway specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing is recommended. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is performed using any one of several in-house and commercial PCR assays to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA30,31. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 must be performed in appropriately equipped laboratories by staff trained in the relevant technical and safety procedures. Initial processing of specimens (before inactivation) should be done in a biological safety cabinet. Molecular testing should be conducted in a BSL-2 laboratory. 231 (104) Viral culture and isolation should only be performed by properly trained and competent personnel in a BSL-3 laboratory.",

As the number of days increases from initial symptom onset, the chest radiograph has an increased likelihood of being abnormal 159 (110) In patients presenting with moderate to severe symptoms, CXR, if available, may be useful in addition to clinical judgment to determine whether there is a need for additional assessment in a hospital setting. 159 (110) Similar to CXR, CT should only be performed if the results are expected to influence patient management (\u2026) The following is a list of potential indications or clinical scenarios for which CT chest may be warranted ( Figure 5) It is recommended to conduct radiation examination for patients with moderate, severe and extremely severe ARI for the purpose of triage, assessing the nature of changes in the chest cavity and determining the prognosis of the disease: -performing CT of the lungs without intravenous contrast enhancement in inpatient conditions or in outpatient settings -with indications for hospitalization; -performing RG of the lungs in two projections, if CT is not possible in a given medical organization / clinical situation. 140 (105) CT is better than Chest Xray for diagnosis early.

It should not be done too early: recommendation around 3 months. This point remains to be clarified, however, because the data are non-existent. 2 / Patient who remains or becomes symptomatic again: Imaging is recommended, to be decided between non-injected CT and angiography, depending on the clinic and biology, and knowing that a threshold of D-dimers a little higher than usual can probably be tolerated in these patients. 153 (108) Chest radiography is not sensitive for the detection of ground glass opacities, which are the main imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia. It should be restricted to the follow-up of patients admitted to intensive care units, who are too fragile to be sent for CT 153 (108) Chest ultrasound does not allow differentiation between bacterial and viral pneumoniae, nor between pulmonary oedema and infection. Ultrasound is used at the bedside to diagnose complications such as a pneumothorax under mechanical ventilation or pleural effusions and can help in adjusting mechanical ventilation or monitoring pulmonary fluid load. 159 (110) Chest X-rays are useful in clinically worsening patients, but daily chest X-rays in stable patients are not necessary and may increase the risk of viral transmission6,7 to health care workers. 171 (123) Focused lung ultrasound and general lung ultrasound (F-LUS/ LUS) is useful to monitor disease progression and to diagnose complications at the bedside with minimal exposure of disease to fellow patients and health-care personnel.",

Most of the documents were developed without any search for primary evidence and relied on expert consensus. Only a small fraction of the documents obtained scores equal to or above 50% for at least three quality domains in the AGREE-II tool, and only 52 recommendations included an statement about their strength. Despite the methodological limitations, it was possible to map the role of RT-PCR assays, imaging and serological tests to guide the management of COVID-19. We found a predominant role for RT-PCR in several stages of the disease. Besides, we identified the role of imaging tests to grade the severity of the disease. We identified several areas of consensus about testing in different disease stages. These areas included the use of RT-PCR for SARS-Cov-2 detection, the limited role of bronchoscopy, and",

It should be restricted to the follow-up of patients admitted to intensive care units, who are too fragile to be sent for CT 153 Chest ultrasound does not allow differentiation between bacterial and viral pneumoniae, nor between pulmonary oedema and infection. Ultrasound is used at the bedside to diagnose complications such as a pneumothorax under mechanical ventilation or pleural effusions and can help in adjusting mechanical ventilation or monitoring pulmonary fluid load.ECG is required for all hospitalized patients to measure baseline QT interval as some subjects may require drugs like chloroquine and/or azithromycin which may cause QT interval prolongation and cardiovascular events. QUESTION 6: For which patient and with what delay should a control image be made to a patient who has had Covid-19? 1 / Patient who is no longer symptomatic: 1.1 / For those who have made a \"light\" Covid-19 (ambulatory forms), the control scanner is not indicated. 1.2 / For those who have had a larger Covid-19 with the need for hospitalization, a chest CT scan without injection is useful, in search of a fibrotic evolution. It should not be done too early: recommendation around 3 months. This point remains to be clarified, however, because the data are non-existent. 2 / Patient who remains or becomes symptomatic again: Imaging is recommended, to be decided between non-injected CT and angiography, depending on the clinic and biology, and knowing that a threshold of D-dimers a little higher than usual can probably be tolerated in these patients.173 in cases of clinical deterioration, CT imaging is recommended to assess COVID-19 progression, secondary cardiopulmonary abnormalities such as pulmonary embolism or bacterial pneumonia attached to it, or heart failure secondary to possible COVID-19 myocardial damage Condiciones para el alta: a) Cl\u00ednica: Mejor\u00eda del estado general: i.

Samples to be sent are: \u00b7 Upper respiratory tract samples -A sample from the upper respiratory tract should be sent from all patients. A single site is sufficient. Currently, a nasopharyngeal swab is the preferred specimen, but in patients where this is not possible (e.g. recent nasal surgery, or severe coagulopathy), an oropharyngeal, nasal mid-turbinate, or anterior nares swab can be collected instead. Lower respiratory tract samples -send when available. Lower respiratory tract samples may have a higher sensitivity than upper respiratory tract samples.25, 30 Sputum, tracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are all acceptable samples to send. Sputum induction should not be performed however. 243 (115) Virus detection can be done with (real-time) reverse transcription (RT) PCR for viral RNA detection . Of course, for optimal detection of the virus, independent of the technique, the sample collection -nasopharynx (nose) what and oropharynx (throat)what -must be done correctly. SARS-CoV-2 is more detectable in nasopharyngeal smears than in oropharyngeal smears in patients with COVID-19. It remains important to collect both, as there are patients who are only positive at one of the two sites. Therefore, for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, always submit a nasopharyngeal swab, in addition to an oropharyngeal swab and, if possible, a sputum sample or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid). In addition, testing for other respiratory viruses and bacteria should be considered when clinically indicated. 149(106) Depending on local epidemiology and clinical symptoms, test for other potential etiologies (e.g. malaria, dengue fever, typhoid fever) as appropriate. 149(106) For COVID-19 patients with severe or critical disease, also collect blood cultures, ideally prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy(3). 229 (77) If required for case management, patients should also be tested for other pathogens, as recommended in local clinical management guidelines, but this should never delay testing for SARS-CoV-2 [99, 100].

It is recommended to conduct microbiological diagnostics (culture) and / or PCR diagnostics for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Legionella pneumophila, as well as other pathogens of bacterial respiratory infections of the lower respiratory tract 120 (98) Dual infections with other respiratory infections (viral, bacterial and fungal) have been found in COVID-19 patients. Depending on local epidemiology and clinical symptoms, test for other potential etiologies (e.g. Influenza, other respiratory viruses, malaria, dengue fever, typhoid fever) as appropriate. 120 (98) For COVID-19 patients with severe disease, also collect blood cultures, ideally prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy 129 (102) 2. For differential diagnostic bacteriological examination:-Collection of several blood cultures (each aerobic + anaerobic) on E + R; -Sputum, BAL, tracheobronchial secretion on E + R; -Urine diagnostics on pneumococci, legionella 222 (80) Collect blood cultures for bacteria where clinically indicated based on the presentingsyndrome, for example, sepsis or severe pneumonia, ideally before antimicrobial therapy.

The use of a systematic angiogram is not validated. In pauci-symptomatic patients without the need for oxygenation and without risk factors (obesity, hypertension, immunosuppression), there is no place for chest imaging. 153 (108) CT allows evaluation of disease extent at baseline, which may help to predict a poor outcome and the need for ventilation. If supplementary oxygen is needed in patients with limited disease extension, other diagnoses, especially pulmonary embolism, should be suspected and an additional contrastenhanced CT acquisition may be indicated. 153",
