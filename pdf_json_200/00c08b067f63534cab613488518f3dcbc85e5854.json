            "text": "Considering that many patients with underlying psychiatric disorders may be infected with COVID-19, and that up to 25% of patients affected by COVID-19 were shown to experience a new onset of psychiatric manifestations (such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, obsessivecompulsive disorder, reactive psychosis or post-traumatic stress disorder) [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , concomitant use of psychotropic medications and COVID-19 therapies is highly probable. Additionally, intensive care support and COVID-19 therapies showing psychiatric side effects might be an additional risk factor for the onset of psychiatric symptoms and delirium, requiring adequate treatment with psychotropic agents [20] . Psychotropic medications may be especially involved in clinically relevant drug interactions in the COVID-19 scenario, by virtue of: (1) extensive activity as substrates and/or inhibitors/inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes, thus potentially causing bidirectional pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions with COVID-19 therapies; (2) synergistic toxicity with different COVID-19 agents, leading to clinically relevant pharmacodynamic (PD) interactions (e.g. QT prolongation); (3) the relevant impact of COVID-19 in causing multiple organ failure (e.g. liver and renal impairment, haematological effects), and a cytokine storm relevantly affecting both PK/PD properties of psychotropic medications and CYP activity, thus resulting in significant drug-disease interactions [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Cytokine release syndrome represents a life-threatening systemic inflammatory syndrome involving elevated levels of circulating cytokines and immunecell hyperactivation, and may play a major role in causing multi-organ failure in the late stages of COVID-19 [24] . The elevated levels of circulating cytokines are responsible for both the impaired activity of different CYP450 isozymes and the use of several anti-inflammatory and/ or immunomodulatory agents in severe forms of COVID-19, thus contributing to the occurrence of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions.",

Antiviral agents are considered more appropriate in the early phase of infection, characterised by viral replication, while immunomodulatory agents should be reserved for later stages, characterised mainly by systemic hyperinflammation [5] . Likewise, while long-term psychiatric therapies are usually maintained in outpatient/inpatient settings in cases of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection, these medications are commonly discontinued in cases of severe COVID-19 forms requiring ICU admission [25] . In these latter cases, psychotropic use is limited to a few agents for sedation and treatment of delirium. Consequently, clinically relevant interactions between psychotropic agents and COVID-19 therapies, although demonstrated in healthy volunteers or predicted according to PK/PD properties, may not occur considering that the two agents are not concomitantly used in a specific scenario.",

All studies or case series/reports providing PK data or describing clinically relevant PD events resulting from the coadministration of the two specific agents were included in our review. Second, information on drug-drug PK and PD interactions between psychotropic medications and COVID-19 agents was searched by checking the updated COVID-19 drug interaction webpage of the University of Liverpool [29] and the summaries of product characteristics. Drug-drug interactions were classified into three different categories according to the degree of severity and clinical relevance: (1) low risk, identifying agents exhibiting no predicted interaction; (2) moderate risk, identifying agents exhibiting a predicted interaction according to PK/PD properties with unknown clinical relevance; (3) high risk, identifying agents exhibiting a clinically relevant interaction, for which avoidance of concomitant administration or dose adjustment should be considered. Finally, applicability in different COVID-19 scenarios was provided for each identified drug interaction, according to the severity of disease.",

            "text": "Although drug interactions between psychotropic medications and COVID-19 therapies may theoretically involve each of the four PK ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) phases [30] , the most relevant mechanisms concern metabolic activity on the CYP microsomal system and drug transporters (mainly P-gp) according to lipophilic properties of psychotropic agents [26, 31, 32] . The influences of psychotropic medications and of COVID-19 therapies on CYP450 and drug transporters activities are summarised in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. Psychotropic agents are largely metabolised by the CYP system. The CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 isozymes are mainly involved in the metabolism of several antidepressants (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) and antipsychotic medications (of both first and second generation), while different sedative hypnotics and mood stabilisers (apart from oxazepam-like benzodiazepines, valproic acid, lamotrigine and lithium) are metabolised by the CYP3A4 isozyme [26] . Additionally, concerns in terms of relevant drug interactions may arise as a result of inhibitory or induced activity on CYP. Fluoxetine, paroxetine and bupropion are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, fluvoxamine is a strong inhibitor of both CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, whereas carbamazepine is a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp [26] . With regard to COVID-19 therapies, the major issues in terms of relevant drug interactions may be associated with the use of antiretrovirals. Both darunavir/cobicistat and lopinavir/ritonavir are strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Colchicine and ruxolitinib are largely metabolised by CYP3A4, and thus their metabolism may be significantly affected in the case of coadministration with psychotropic medications that act as inhibitors or inducers of this isoenzyme.",

Expected toxicity is commonly additive, extremely rarely synergistic.

Specifically, the increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1 and IL-6) may consistently reduce the activity of CYP3A4, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 [23, [35] [36] [37] , and this may potentially affect the metabolism of those psychotropic agents that are substrates of these isoenzymes. Interestingly, among patients with severe COVID-19 treated with darunavir, a CYP3A4 substrate, it was shown that high IL-6 levels significantly decrease drug clearance [38] . This supports the idea that in severe forms of COVID-19, dosing optimisation of CYP3A4 substrates, including several psychotropic medications, may be needed. Conversely, no significant influence of proinflammatory cytokine levels was documented on CYP2D6 activity [23, 37] . This suggests that the metabolism of several antidepressants and antipsychotic agents that are CYP2D6 substrates should not be affected by the hyperimmune response observed in severe forms of COVID-19.",

Unfortunately, most of these studies were performed in healthy volunteers before the pandemic, whereas only a minority of case reports outlined the occurrence of clinically relevant interactions between these agents among patients with COVID-19. The extent of clinical relevance based on PD effects and the need for dose adjustments reported in these studies were highly variable. Consequently, interpretation of these findings with extrapolation to patients with COVID-19 requires caution. Several limitations of these PK studies may somewhat affect the full applicability of the reported findings in the COVID-19 scenario (e.g. lack of subjects showing underlying diseases and/or polytherapy, lack of critical acute conditions). However, they may provide useful information concerning the occurrence of clinically relevant drug interactions between psychotropic medications and repurposed COVID-19 agents.",

Overall, 12 PK studies were performed in healthy volunteers, and two case reports and one retrospective study were also identified by our search (Table 3) . In regard to SSRIs, Gutierrez et al. [41] found no significant alteration in th edisposition of escitalopram (in terms of peak concentration [C max ], area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC] and clearance [CL]) caused by concomitant administration of ritonavir in a randomised, openlabel, three-way crossover study performed in 18 healthy volunteers. Conversely, Lorenzini et al. [42] described a case of serotonin syndrome in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) concomitantly treated with darunavir/ ritonavir and escitalopram. Escitalopram serum concentrations were roughly three times as high as the upper threshold of the therapeutic range (695 nmol/L vs 250 nmol/L), potentially due to CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibition caused by ritonavir. van der Lee et al. [43] found an unexpectedly decreased paroxetine exposure (1.55-fold and 1.51-fold for AUC and C max , respectively) in 23 healthy volunteers concomitantly treated with fosamprenavir/ritonavir, probably related to displacement from protein binding of paroxetine resulting in higher CL, considering that both paroxetine (95%) and fosamprenavir/ritonavir (respectively 90% and 98%) are highly bound to plasma proteins. Similarly, Hanan et al. [44] found an unexpected decrease in sertraline disposition (respectively 1.49-fold and 1.36-fold for AUC and C max ) in 31 HIV-infected and uninfected subjects treated with ritonavir associated with different protease inhibitors (PIs), including lopinavir. The findings were attributed to induction of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity. Consequently, it was concluded that higher paroxetine or sertraline dosage may be required in patients concomitantly treated with PIs and ritonavir to retain antidepressants effects. Ouellet et al. [45] found no significant alteration in ritonavir disposition among 16 healthy volunteers cotreated with the moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor fluoxetine. Consequently, it may be speculated that no lopinavir/ ritonavir dose adjustments should be required in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 receiving fluoxetine treatment. Finally, in a retrospective study including 575 patients affected by venous thromboembolism and treated with fulldose enoxaparin, Samuel and Seifert [46] reported a higher risk of major bleeding in subjects treated with escitalopram compared with those receiving other SSRIs or no antidepressant therapy. This is probably due to the well-known increased risk of bleeding associated with SSRIs and resulting in additive PD toxicity [47] .",

The findings could be due to cobicistat-and/or ritonavir-mediated CYP2D6 inhibition and should prompt lowering of the initial or maintenance dose of desipramine in patients receiving cotreatment with these PIs. However, given the current limited use of desipramine and other TCAs as first-line treatment for depression, the relevance of these PK interactions in the COVID-19 setting is expected currently to be of limited interest [51] . Five PK studies assessed in healthy volunteers the impact of ritonavir alone and/or in combination with lopinavir on bupropion exposure [52] [53] [54] [55] . Consistent findings were found in terms of decreased bupropion disposition, from 20 to 62-66% for C max and AUC, respectively, possibly due to induction of CYP2B6 and UGT enzymes caused by ritonavir. Consequently, a higher bupropion dosage could be appropriate in patients with COVID-19 concomitantly treated with lopinavir/ritonavir whenever antidepressant treatment is deemed ineffective.",

[56] found a significant increase in trazodone exposure (respectively 2.37-fold and 2.22-fold in AUC and half-life) coupled with a 2.07-fold decreased CL among ten healthy subjects concomitantly receiving ritonavir, possibly resulting from strong inhibitory activity on CYP3A4. A significant impairment of psychomotor performance and increased sedation were also reported. Consequently, it was recommended that the coadministration of trazodone and PIs/ritonavir should be avoided or the trazodone dose should be reduced by 50-75%. No other PK DDI between antidepressants and COVID-19 agents has been studied. However, based on the PK/PD properties of the different medications, it may be speculated that some clinically relevant interactions might occur. Predicted DDIs and their potential risk are summarised in Table 1 of the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM). No further high-risk PK or PD interactions between antidepressants and COVID-19 therapies can be predicted. For lopinavir/ritonavir and for darunavir/cobicistat, a moderate risk of relevant PK interactions (higher exposure of antidepressants metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 requiring dose adjustments) and PD (QT prolongation with concomitant administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and several SSRIs, TCAs, mianserin, mirtazapine, or trazodone) interactions could be predicted. In patients affected by a cytokine storm and treated with anti-IL-6 and/or anti-IL-1 agents such as tocilizumab, siltuximab and canakinumab, an upregulation of CYP3A4 activity may be expected [57] . Consequently, for antidepressants that are metabolised by CYP3A4, it might be necessary to increase the dosage for ensuring efficacy, even if the magnitude of this increase is difficult to predict a priori. However, it should be mentioned that anti-IL-6 and IL-1 agents are used in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU in which oral antidepressants are usually stopped. No clinically relevant interactions involving remdesivir, colchicine, ruxolitinib, dexamethasone, bamlanivimab and casirivimab/imdevimab are expected to occur with antidepressants.",

This was attributed to the inhibitory activity of ritonavir on CYP3A4-and CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of aripiprazole and called for an aripiprazole TDM-based dose adjustment (reduction by 50-80%), or avoidance of coadministration. Interestingly, opposite findings were reported by Hahn and Roll [61] in a patient with HIV affected by bipolar disorder who experienced a relapse of mood disorder associated with an aripiprazole (both oral and intramuscular depot formulations) serum concentration below the therapeutic range (94 ng/mL vs 150-500 ng/mL) during cotreatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. The findings were attributed to the patients' status of extensive or ultrarapid metaboliser of CYP2D6 that was able to overcome the inhibition of CY2D6 and 3A4 activity promoted by ritonavir.

[62] described two cases of quetiapine toxicity (increased sedation, worsened mental confusion, hyperglycaemia, weight gain) among patients with HIV with bipolar disorder concomitantly treated with atazanavir/ ritonavir. This was potentially due to the inhibitory activity on CYP3A4, although a confirmatory PK analysis and/ or quetiapine TDM were not performed. Similarly, Geraci et al. [63] reported a case of priapism in a patient with HIV affected by schizoaffective disorder treated with quetiapine and perphenazine concomitantly receiving lopinavir/ritonavir. The inhibitory activity of ritonavir on CYP3A4 and 2D6 may have increased antipsychotic agent concentrations potentially leading to prolonged \u03b1-adrenergic blockade and consequent low-flow priapism. According to the summary of product characteristics, quetiapine dose should be reduced by one-sixth in the case of co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ritonavir, to prevent the occurrence of life-threatening adverse events (e.g. QT prolongation). Olanzapine should be considered as an alternative agent to replace quetiapine according to PK/PD properties in patients affected by COVID-19 treated with lopinavir/ ritonavir [64] .",

High-risk PK or PD interactions between antipsychotic agents (namely haloperidol, pimozide, sertindole, and ziprasidone) and antiretrovirals (darunavir/cobicistat or lopinavir/ritonavir) have been detected, mainly associated with an increase in antipsychotic exposure leading to life-threatening events (e.g. neuroleptic malignant syndrome, fatal arrhythmias caused by QT prolongation) [69, 70] . Consequently, coadministration should be cautiously avoided or antipsychotic dosage should be reduced (e.g. by one-sixth for quetiapine or 50% for iloperidone) [71] . Interestingly, a decrease in olanzapine exposure may occur during cotreatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, due to induction of CYP1A2 and UGT enzymes, possibly requiring an olanzapine dose increase [64] . The risk of PK or PD interactions between lopinavir/ritonavir and other antipsychotic agents may be moderate, and mainly concerns the risk of QT prolongation exhibited by each specific agent. Similarly, darunavir/cobicistat may increase the exposure of several antipsychotic agents metabolised by CYP3A4, thus requiring dose adjustments [69, 70] . According to CYP status, paliperidone and ziprasidone may be optimal alternatives to minimise the occurrence of clinically relevant interactions with PIs, although ziprasidone poses a high risk of QT prolongation in patients concomitantly treated with lopinavir/ritonavir.",

Consequently, for those antipsychotic agents that are metabolised by CYP3A4, it might be necessary to increase the dosage to ensure efficacy, even if the magnitude of this increase is difficult to predict a priori. However, it should be mentioned that anti-IL-6 and IL-1 agents are used in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU in which oral antipsychotic agents are usually stopped. Conversely, haloperidol is the only antipsychotic agent for which the magnitude of the effect could be clinically relevant in the ICU setting. When administered parenterally, a dosage increase could be needed to ensure adequate anti-delirium efficacy under these circumstances, closely monitoring QT prolongation and occurrence of torsade de pointes, regardless of potential drug interactions. Indeed, some patients may receive long-acting injectable antipsychotic agents to manage schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. In this scenario, clinically relevant drug interactions may also occur despite ICU admission because of the long elimination half-life of these agents.",

The coadministration of carbamazepine with lopinavir/ritonavir or with darunavir/cobicistat should be avoided if not strictly necessary, or close monitoring of carbamazepine serum concentrations coupled with appropriate dose adjustments should be implemented. Given the strong inducer activity of carbamazepine on CYP3A4 [84] , a significant reduction in the exposure of several substrates of this isozyme is expected, including remdesivir, colchicine, ruxolitinib and dexamethasone. An increased dosage of these agents should be considered.",

The findings were due to a reversal of the inhibitory activity promoted by this proinflammatory cytokine on CYP3A4 isozyme.

            "text": "Several PK studies investigated the impact of ritonavir and/or of ritonavir-boosted PIs on benzodiazepine metabolism and exposure [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] . Greenblatt et al. [90] found a significant increase in alprazolam exposure (2.48-fold in AUC) in ten healthy volunteers concomitantly receiving ritonavir, leading to augmented sedation and performance impairment. Similarly, Menon et al. [91] found a moderate increase in alprazolam disposition (34% in AUC) in 12 healthy subjects receiving paritaprevir/ritonavir, due to inhibitory activity of ritonavir on CYP3A4. In the same study [91] , authors also reported no significant variations in zolpidem exposure in 12 healthy volunteers with concomitant administration of paritaprevir/ritonavir. A significant increase in midazolam exposure (respectively from 3.02-fold to 26.41-fold for AUC and from 1.15-fold to 4.27-fold for C max ) in healthy volunteers concomitantly treated with ritonavir alone or ritonavir-boosted PIs has been reported, caused by strong inhibition of CYP3A4 [92] [93] [94] [95] . Notably, a more pronounced increase in midazolam disposition was found with oral compared with intravenous administration [95] . The concomitant use of midazolam and ritonavir should be avoided, or solely reserved for intubated ICU patients in which lower midazolam dosage should be required to achieve adequate sedation [69] . A retrospective cohort study [96] including 241 patients with HIV undergoing bronchoscopy reported an increased relative risk of severe prolonged sedation (risk ratio (RR) 6.21; 95% confidence interval 1.53-25.12) in patients receiving intravenous midazolam (median dose 4 mg) concomitantly treated with ritonavir-boosted PIs compared with those using other antiretroviral agents. Greenblatt et al. [97] found a significant increase in triazolam exposure (20.39-fold in AUC) in six healthy volunteers receiving ritonavir, due to strong inhibitory activity on CYP3A4 and resulting in increased sedation and impairment of psychomotor performance. Similarly, Culm-Merdeck et al. [98] reported a relevant increase in triazolam disposition (21.1fold in AUC) in 23 healthy subjects concomitantly treated with ritonavir. Consequently, coadministration of triazolam and ritonavir-boosted PIs should be avoided to prevent excessive sedation and respiratory depression. Conversely, ritonavir caused only a moderate increase in zolpidem exposure (respectively 1.28-fold and 1.22-fold in AUC and C max ) [97] , thus A summary of predicted PK and PD interactions between sedative hypnotics and COVID-19 agents is shown in Table 4 of the ESM. A high or moderate risk of clinically relevant drug interactions may be expected only when sedative hypnotics that are substrates of CYP3A4 are concomitantly used in patients with COVID-19 receiving antiretroviral agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, namely ritonavir or cobicistat. The combination may potentially cause severe prolonged sedation associated with respiratory depression (particularly with midazolam and triazolam). In this scenario, the use of oxazepam-like benzodiazepines (namely lorazepam, lormetazepam, oxazepam and temazepam), exhibiting no metabolism through CYP450 pathway, should be preferred [99] . According to the study of Zhuang et al. [87] , a higher midazolam dose could be required to provide adequate sedation in patients with severe COVID-19 affected by a cytokine storm and managed with anti-IL-6 agents (tocilizumab or siltuximab).No clinically relevant interactions involving remdesivir, colchicine, dexamethasone, enoxaparin, ruxolitinib, bamlanivimab and casirivimab/imdevimab are expected to occur with sedative hypnotics according to PK/PD properties.",

This represents an important concern given that lopinavir/ritonavir and darunavir/cobicistat were used in mild-to-moderate forms of COVID-19 (also including outpatient management), in which long-term concomitant treatment with oral psychotropic agents are usually maintained. In contrast, in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring ICU admission, long-term therapies (including psychotropic agents) are abruptly suspended, and thus the risk should be lower in this setting. In this latter scenario, only a few drugs are commonly used through parenteral administration to provide adequate sedation or a delirolytic effect (e.g. midazolam, haloperidol), and potential relevant drug interactions could be successfully managed thanks to the fact that ICU patients are intubated (i.e. no risk of severe respiratory depression caused by midazolam overexposure) and carefully monitored (i.e. early identification of QT prolongation caused by increased disposition of haloperidol). Indeed, some patients may receive long-acting injectable antipsychotic agents to manage schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. In this scenario, clinically relevant drug interactions may also occur despite ICU admission because of the long elimination half-life of these agents.",

A practical algorithm to manage the occurrence of clinically relevant drug interactions between psychotropic medications and COVID-19 agents according to disease severity is provided in Fig. 2 . In outpatient/inpatient scenarios concerning mild-to-moderate COVID-19, antiretrovirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and darunavir/cobicistat) represent the agents showing the higher risk of significant drug interactions. While in the case of concomitant administration with antidepressants, only a moderate risk of clinically relevant interactions could be recognised according to an increase in antidepressant exposure and QT prolongation (e.g. citalopram, fluoxetine, TCAs, trazodone), a high risk of significant interactions resulting in life-threatening events could be expected with several antipsychotic agents (i.e. haloperidol, quetiapine), mood stabilisers (i.e. carbamazepine) and sedative hypnotics (i.e., midazolam, triazolam). Notably, the dosage of different psychotropic agents (e.g. bupropion, olanzapine, lamotrigine) should be increased in the case of concomitant administration with antiretrovirals to achieve desired effects. In this scenario, the use of psychotropic agents (e.g. oxazepam-like benzodiazepines, olanzapine), exhibiting no or minimal metabolism through the CYP450 pathway (particularly CYP3A4), should be preferred. Conversely, in inpatient/ICU scenarios concerning moderate-to-severe COVID-19, no concerns for the occurrence of clinically relevant interactions with psychotropic agents exist, given that oral medications are usually abruptly suspended. Anti-inflammatory therapies used for severe COVID-19 pose no relevant PK/PD issues able to cause high-risk drug interactions with psychotropic agents. Only the use of anti-IL-1 or IL-6 agents may reverse the inhibitory effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on CYP450, thus potentially causing underexposure of midazolam or haloperidol, while carbamazepine may reduce the disposition of different COVID-19 therapies (e.g. colchicine, dexamethasone, ruxolitinib).",

[102] provided practical recommendations for patients affected by psychiatric disorders requiring concomitant treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir in the COVID-19 setting. Electrocardiogram monitoring was recommended for properly managing expected PK/PD interactions, leading to QT prolongation and potential life-threatening arrhythmias. Additionally, three different clinical scenarios were discussed. First, olanzapine was recommended as first-line therapy in agitated delirium, and quetiapine should be avoided. This is consistent with the findings reported in PK studies and in case reports [58, 59, [62] [63] [64] 71] . Second, essential treatments (e.g. antipsychotic agents, mood stabilisers) should be maintained in severe mental illness and should be prioritised, avoiding abrupt withdrawal. In this scenario, careful monitoring for clinically relevant PK/PD interactions coupled with dose adjustment should be implemented. This is especially true when psychotropic agents at high risk for drug interactions are co-administered with lopinavir/ritonavir. Third, in nonsevere mental illness with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support coupled with prompt identification and treatment of symptoms should be provided. In this scenario, the use of antidepressants or sedative hypnotics showing a low risk for PK/PD interactions with COVID-19 agents (e.g. oxazepam-like benzodiazepines, fluoxetine, sertraline) should be preferred. This is consistent with the findings reported in PK studies [44, 45] . It should not be overlooked that close monitoring should be performed whenever dose adjustments are extended beyond the recommendations provided in the summary of product characteristics of a specific agent. Furthermore, in the case of PD interactions leading to QT prolongation or other additive toxicity (e.g. hepatic, haematological), tailored monitoring should be promptly implemented.",
