To investigate the differences in pathogenesis and epigenetic mechanisms between the two strains, differential expression and correlation analyses of the microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA in swine testicular (ST) cells infected with YN15, YN144, and mock were performed on three comparison groups (YN15 vs Control, YN144 vs Control, and YN15 vs YN144). The mRNA and miRNA expression profiles were obtained using next-generation sequencing (NGS), and the differentially expressed (DE) (p-value < 0.05) mRNA and miRNA were obtained using DESeq R package. mRNAs targeted by DE miRNAs were predicted using the miRanda algortithm. 8039, 8631 and 3310 DE mRNAs, and 36, 36, and 22 DE miRNAs were identified in the three comparison groups, respectively. 14,140, 15,367 and 3771 DE miRNA-mRNA (targeted by DE miRNAs) interaction pairs with negatively correlated expression patterns were identified, and interaction networks were constructed using Cytoscape. Six DE miRNAs and six DE mRNAs were randomly selected to verify the sequencing data by real-time relative quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Based on bioinformatics analysis, we discovered the differences were mostly involved in host immune responses and viral pathogenicity, including NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, etc. This is the first comprehensive comparison of DE miRNA-mRNA pairs in YN15 and YN144 infection in vitro, which could provide novel strategies for the prevention and control of PED.",

The NF-\u03baB signaling pathway plays a crucial part in host immunity during viral infections 13 . The PEDV N protein is capable of inhibiting the activation of this signaling pathway activation in HEK-293 T cells 14 The JAK-STAT signaling pathway also plays a major role in host innate immunity, especially as it pertains to inflammatory pathogenesis as seen in IBD 15 . In this work, cytokines related to this signaling pathway were found to be up-regulated during variant PEDV strain infection, especially during YN144 infection. The phosphorylation and translocation of STAT1, STAT2 and STAT3 promotes the antiviral ability of cells by up-regulating the transcription of interferon (IFN) -stimulated genes (ISG) to fight viral infection 16 . Our deep sequencing data showed that STAT1 and STAT3 were markedly up-regulated in YN144-infected ST cells (YN144 vs Control, STAT1: p-value = 9.0857E\u221217, and STAT3: p-value = 3.00E\u221211) compared with YN15-infected ST cells (YN15 vs Control, STAT1: p-value = 6.43E\u221212, and STAT3: p-value > 0.05). STAT2 expression displayed no obvious changes during YN144 infection (YN144 vs Control, p-value > 0.05), but was notably decreased during YN15 infection (YN15 vs Control, p-value = 6.81E\u221208). As key members of this signaling pathway, both the oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) protein family (OAS1, OAS2, and OASL) and the Mx dynamin-like GTPases (MX1 and MX2) induced by type I and type III IFN participate in antiviral activity and inhibit virus replication 17, 18 . Our research shows that the expressions of the above genes can be substantially activated at early stages of YN144 infection, while their expressions were moderate at early stages of YN15 infection (YN15 vs YN144, OAS1:",

All of miR-155-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-29b have been proved to have immense effects on inflammation and negatively regulate the innate immune responses to various microorganisms [19] [20] [21] . For example, miR-155 and miR-139-5p can constitute a negative feedback loop in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by targeting multiple key proteins, leading to the repression of NF-\u03baB activation in response to viral or microbial stimuli 19, 20 . The expression of miR-155 was enhanced in microglial cells during Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection, and JEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 as well as downstream ISG mRNA expression was significantly reduced in microglial overexpressing miR-155 19 .The knock-out or inhibition of miR-155 decreases hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremia in children with leukemia 22 . miR-29b is capable of inhibiting the JAK-STAT signaling pathway by IFN-\u03b3 in CD8 + T cells and TH1 effector cells 21 .

Ssc-miR-29b was significantly up-regulated in ST cells infected with YN15, but down-regulated in cells infected with YN144.

Other research has demonstrated that miR-10a is highly expressed in the intestines and plays a crucial role in the host immune response to the microbiota in a mouse model, and the intestinal microbiota negatively regulates miR-10a expression by targeting IL-12/ IL-23p40 24 .

All of the DE miRNAs that were up-regulated during YN144 infection and downregulated during YN15 infection are capable of activating the host immune response. Even more surprising, the same phenomenon occurs among all commonly up-regulated miRNAs that the expression levels of the up-regulated miRNAs during YN15 infection were significantly higher than during YN144 infection, and all of them have been reported to inhibit the NF-\u03baB or JAK-STAT signaling pathway.

In contrast, YN15 can invade intestinal epithelial cells and cause serious intestinal injury and inflammation, leading to serious diarrhea in piglets. It is worth noting that diarrhea in piglet is often caused by viral-bacterial co-infections in the farm setting 26 . Coincidentally, the GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of up-regulated mRNA-down-regulated miRNA pairs in YN15-infected ST cells compared with YN144-infected ST cells, showed that the major signaling pathways represented include focal adhesion, regulation of action cytoskeleton, endocytosis, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. All of these pathways are closely related to pathogenicity, and in particular, the destruction of host cell structure during microbial invasion 27 .",

For example, activation of this signaling pathway promotes actin rearrangement, leading to the host inflammatory response that persists in IBD 37 . Additionally, cell destruction caused by viruses can expose cryptic receptors to promote bacteria adhesion and it is well known, that some symbiotic gut microbiota and invasive intestinal pathogens invade epithelial cells, and cause extensive intestinal damage [38] [39] [40] . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection can expose the adhesion proteins of intestinal epithelial cells, thereby providing the attachment sites for enterotoxigenic E. coli K88 (ETEC) invasion, inducing an epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like phenotype, and resulting in virus-bacteria co-infection 41 . Like TGEV, PEDV disrupts porcine intestinal epithelial cells; however, the mechanism of PEDV and bacteria co-infection is not clear 40 . Interestingly, paramyxovirus and Streptococcus pneumonia co-infection can only be supported by the highly pathogenic virus strains and not by the low pathogenic virus strains 42 . In addition, mTOR, a downstream factor of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, can inhibit T helper cell differentiation and thus suppress the host immune response 43 . Importantly, the above phenomenon is reflected in our sequencing data demonstrationg that YN15 causes significantly greater activation of the above signaling pathways than dose YN144, as measured by the up-regulation of effector genes encoding mTOR, FN1, VCL, ITG\u03b13, ITG\u03b15, ITG\u03b16, ITG\u03b18, ITG\u03b21, and ITG\u03b24 (YN15 vs YN144, p-value = 7.98E-06, p-value = 3.27E-04, p-value = 8.96E-08, p-value = 5.25E-12, p-value = 3.27E-04, p-value = 9.61E-20, p-value = 2.04E-12, p-value = 1.41E-03, and p-value = 2.52E-12, respectively) in ST cells.

In the present study, YN15 exhibited greater inhibition of ssc-miR-9 expression and greater activation of FN1, ITG\u03b21, and ITG\u03b15 expression than the YN144 strain. These results may provide us with new insights into how to inhibit PEDV replication and secondary bacterial infection. To promote cell invasion and metastasis, miR-425-5p could activate ITG\u03b21expression through the suppression of suppressor of cancer cell invasion (SCAI) expression 45 . It is worth mentioning that miR-184 is normally found in abundance in healthy individuals; however, down-regulation of miR-184 leads to epithelial thinning and prolonged wound healing, possibly contributing to pathology 46 .

Based on our sequencing data, genes enrichment analysis, and information from the literature, we speculate that YN15 infection would cause more serious pathological damage, and YN144 infection would markedly activated host immune responses in vivo and vitro, which correspond well with our previous studies in piglets and prediction that YN144 does not causes clinical symptoms, but still results in effective antibody production comparable to levels achieved by vaccination 5 . All differences are very attractive in helping researchers unravel a new antiviral mechanism of PEDV infection, and therefore provide researchers with further avenues to the porcine industry.",

A total quantity of 3 \u03bcg RNA per sample was used as input for the RNA sample preparations. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. In order to select cDNA fragments of 150-200 bp in length, library fragments were purified using the AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). The PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina). The library preparations were then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform and 125 bp/150 bp paired-end reads were generated. The index of the reference genome was constructed using Bowtie v2.2.3 and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using TopHat v2.0.12.

NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (NEB, USA) was used to generate the sequencing libraries and index codes that were added to attribute sequences to each sample. Library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system using DNA High Sensitivity Chips. After cluster generation of the index-coded samples, performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina), the library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500/2000 platform, and 50 bp single-end reads were generated. The small RNA tags were mapped to the Sus scrofa sequence by Bowtie 49 . The miRBase20.0 database was used as the reference, and modified software mirdeep2 and sRNA-tools-cli were used to obtain potential miRNA and predict their secondary structures 50 .
