            "text": "Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide causing an outbreak of a respiratory disease, now known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1] . Approximately 107.8 million COVID-19 cases and 2.3 million associated deaths have been reported until 13 February 2021 [2] . The need for a rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tool, in addition to the requirement of an adequate supply of reagents, has led researchers to explore different methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection other than the gold standard method of RT-qPCR [3] , such as isothermal amplification techniques combined with colorimetric detection [4] [5] [6] . Although RT-qPCR tests can be performed without sophisticated equipment and do not require the expertise of well-trained personnel, this technique is prone to detecting unspecific signals, which may lead to false-positive results. However, the combination of RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with Cas effectors improves the accuracy of results due to the collateral cleavage of a reporter molecule in the presence of a target, showing a performance comparable to that of RT-qPCR for viral and bacterial detection [7, 8] , including SARS-CoV-2 (Table S1 ) [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

The samples were randomly selected from 105 positive (cycle threshold [Ct] range: 8-37) and 105 negative patients with COVID-19 symptoms hospitalized at Dr. Abete Municipal Hospital. Nasopharyngeal swabs are the specimen of choice because they have the highest diagnostic performance for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Moreover, the collection of nasopharyngeal swabs is recommended by the World Health Organization and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of Dr. Abete Municipal Hospital. No consent was required from the subjects because all data were analyzed anonymously.",

Resuspension with nuclease-free water is required to hydrate the lyophilized beads containing all components for isothermal amplification and CRISPR detection.
