            "text": "The third pandemic of coronavirus infection, called COVID-19 disease, began recently in China. The newly discovered coronavirus, entitled SARS-CoV-2, is the seventh member of the human coronaviruses. The main pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is severe pneumonia, RNAaemia, accompanied by glass turbidity, and acute cardiac injury. It possesses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome which is 60-140 nm in diameter, and has a size of 26-32 kbp. Viral pathogenesis is accomplished with spike glycoprotein through the employment of a membrane-bound aminopeptidase, called the ACE2, as its primary cell receptor. It has been confirmed that various factors such as different national rules for quarantine and various races or genetic backgrounds might influence the mortality and infection rate of COVID-19 in the geographic areas. In addition to various known and unknown factors and host genetic susceptibility, mutations and genetic variabilities of the virus itself have a critical impact on variable clinical features of COVID-19. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more stable than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, it has a relatively high dynamic mutation rate with respect to other RNA viruses. It's noteworthy that, some mutations can be founder mutations and show specific geographic patterns. Undoubtedly, these mutations can drive viral genetic variability, and because of genotype-phenotype correlation, resulting in a virus with more/lower/no decrease in natural pathogenic fitness or on the other scenario, facilitating their rapid antigenic shifting to escape the host immunity and also inventing a drug resistance virus, so converting it to a more infectious or deadly virus. Overall, the detection of all mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and their relations with pathological changes is nearly impossible, mostly due to asymptomatic subjects. In this review paper, the reported mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and related variations in virus structure and pathogenicity in different geographic areas and genotypes are widely investigated. Many studies need to be repeated in other regions/ locations for other people to confirm the findings. Such studies could benefit patient-specific therapy, according to genotyping patterns of SARS-CoV-2 distribution.",

As more cases were confirmed, many countries worldwide announced restrictions for transportation and implemented quarantine [1] . Findings revealed that not only people with the disease who had a range of symptoms could transmit the virus, but even those who did not develop symptoms were carriers of the virus [2] . In some instances, people infected with the virus while not experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 or even showing mild symptoms of the disease. On the other hand, signs of the disease may change from mild and moderate to acute (critical) and become severe, necessitating special care for the patient with the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) syndrome and accumulation of fluids in the lungs [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . According to epidemiological researches, the clinical outcomes (ranging from asymptotic to death) are heavily influenced by factors such as age, demographic characteristics, clinical care quality, and other potential unknown parameters [8] [9] [10] .",

The other technique is computed tomography of the chest.

These Nsps participate in many viral processes; for example, the Nsp3 is the largest component among other constituents that forms the replication and transcription complex of coronaviruses, which its cleavage by the PL proteinase would result in the promotion of cytokine expression and suppression of the host's innate immune response. 3CLPro protease as another Nsp has an essential role in RNA replication. Many of the Nsps encoded in ORF1ab, including Nsp5, Nsp3, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, Nap12), are responsible for the assembly of the replicas-transcriptase complex in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) [16] . Other replicas consist of proteins that facilitate viral replication and block the intrinsic host immune system by controlling the cellular machinery. Nsp8 and Nsp12 are two monomeric RdRps that are involved in the process of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Nsp8 replicates the virus genome through interacting with ORF6 accessory protein and Nsp9 replicas protein, by binding to RNA. In contrast to Nsp12, Nsp8 has primase capacity that makes it needless of any primers to initiate the viral replication process. In addition to these polymerases, the SARS-CoV-2 has a unique multimeric RNA polymerase composed of Nsp7 and Nsp8, which is responsible for both the initiation and elongation of the newly synthesized fragment of the viral genome [16, 23] .",

            "text": "After fastening to the receptor, the virus enters the host cell cytosol by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) or other proteases such as furin, and fuses the viral and cell membranes. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein contains a cleft-like site. The furin detection location is crucial for detection by pyrolysis and, thus, in viral infection of the virus. This glycoprotein is broken down by furin proteinase into a subunit S1 and S2 like a host cell. Infection begins with the interaction of S1, containing RBD, with the host receptor ACE2, into the cell membrane. The S2 domain is a viral fusion protein and is involved in a mixture of virion glands. Immediately after the virus entrance to the cell, the S glycoprotein is cleaved by the CTSL cathepsin to kill the S2 fusion peptide, and then forms endocytosis and low-pH endosomes, hence activating the fusion of membranes within the endosomes. At the junction between the virus membrane and the cell membrane, a bundle is formed that is likely to release the virus genome into the cytoplasm. The following step in the infection cycle is the translation of replica genes from the RNA virus. The two polymer proteins pp1a and pp1 ab are encoded by two large proteins, ORF rep1a and rep1b. A sliding sequence (5 \u2032 -UUUAAAC-3 \u2032 ) and a pseudoknot RNA help express these proteins, leading to a deformation of the rep1a reading form in the ORF rep1b. Usually, the ribosome opens the pseudoknot structure and continues the translation process until it encounters a pause or reach the end of 11 repetitions in the codon. But sometimes, the ribosome is stopped by the pseudoknot, which prevents stretching and staying in the slippery sequence, and stops the nucleotide reading frame with a backward shift that results in the translation of pp1ab. After the translation process, viral RNA is synthesized, and viral replication complexes are collected. The set of viral replications by the transcription process results in cytopathic effects such as abnormalities in the vascular complexes.

These proteins are secreted into the ER-Golgi intermediate chamber (ERGIC). Here, the viral genomes that encode structural proteins are encapsulated by the N-germ protein in the ERGIC membrane and become mature viruses. Proteinprotein interaction is mainly mediated by M glycoprotein, which is responsible for collecting CoVs. M protein, expressed with E protein, is involved in the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) as well as in the formation of coatings for CoVs. While N glycoprotein causing the formation of VLPs, a combination of genomes encoded in ERGIC enhances virus growth. In the ERGIC chamber, S glycoprotein interacts with M glycoprotein due to being essential for its synthesis. Because M protein is abundant compared to E protein, M protein interaction can be a major source of motivation to mask puberty. Glycoprotein changes the host secretion pathway and releases the accumulation of the virus in the host. The M protein attaches to the nucleocapsid located at the C-terminus of endo domain M and signals viral assembly completion. After assembly, the viruses are transmitted by vesicles to the host cell membrane and are released by exocytosis. By being transported to the cell surface, the S protein combines cell fusion between infected and healthy cells, resulting in a large multinucleated cell that spreads the virus in the host and provides the conditions for the detection of specific antibodies against the virus (Fig. 5 ) [29] .",

The first regular SNP mutation in the virus genome was in nsp2 (241 C > T), which is a critical genomic location. It has been discovered that the nsp2 mutation (241 C > T) has emerged with three other critical mutations including, (3037 C > T), (14408 C > T), and (23403 A > G), that bring about mutations at the amino acid level of RNA primase, and S protein. The mutations as mentioned earlier (241 C > T, 14408 C > T, and 23403 A > G) are located in proteins which are essential for the replication of RNA (241C > T, 14408 C > T), and the spike protein (23403A > G) since it attaches to receptors. This paper recognized that these four mentioned-mutations are common in the SARS-CoV-2 European isolates genomes, where the severity of the infection is mostly more intense than in the other geographical regions. The second amplest SNP mutation in the isolates was (28144 T > C), which has appeared at nsp8, where the amino acid is changed (Leu to Ser), and the third one (26144 G > T) was in nsp3. The nsp3 collaborates with two other proteins called nonstructural protein-4 and 6, to bring about DMVs, which are complexes of the membrane that assist in replicating and assembling RNA. The most common mutation (23403 A > G) was positioned in the S protein sequence. This mutation in D614G (23403 A > G) was placed in the supposed S1-S2 junction part, which splits the spike protein. Analysis of the results demonstrated that nsp8, which is an RNA primase, had the greatest number of mutations (28881 G > A, 28144 T > C, 28882 G > A and 28883 G > C) in comparison to the remaining proteins. Mutations in RNA polymerase or RNA primase might increase fidelity and present obstruction to the usage of nucleotide analogs that are mutagenic. In strains from the US, three mutations in the sequences of nsp8 (28881 G > A, 28882 G > A, and 28883 G > C) have been discovered [16] .",

Moreover, viral mutations over time are regarded as the contributing factors in transmission and severity of the COVID-19 infection [38] . Whereas the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more stable than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, it has a relatively high dynamic mutation rate comparable to other RNA viruses [46] . It's noteworthy that, some mutations can be as founder mutations and show specific geographic patterns. For example, the D614G mutation in S protein is a founder mutation in Europe (appearance from February 16, 2020) [47] . Undoubtedly, these mutations can drive viral genetic variability, and because of genotype-phenotype correlation, resulting in a virus with more/lower/no decrease in natural pathogenic fitness or on the other hand, facilitating their rapid antigenic shifting in order to escape the host immunity and also creating a drug resistance virus, hence converting it to a more infectious or deadly virus (Table 2 ) [47] [48] [49] . Issa et al. discovered 51 distinct non-synonymous amino-acid substitutions in the ORF3a proteins by analyzing 2782 SARS-CoV-2 sequenced isolates. The functional domains of the ORF3a protein are related to pathogenicity and virulence [50] .",

According to the mentioned study, S-D614G has a significantly positive effect on viral replication [47] . Following Yao et al. study, another research showed that S protein is highly mutated, and some of its mutations such as D614G can potentially increase virus infection activity and also the severity of disease [48] . One study showed that a 15-30 nt deletion in the S1/S2 junction region which happened during passaging virus in Vero-E6 cells, reduced the infection rate of theSARS-CoV-2. S1/S2 junction region is cleaved during virus entry to the cell by TMPRSS2 and therefore, deletion mutations in this region can attenuate the infection rate of the virus. So far, the pre-mentioned deletion in the S1/S2 junction region has not been detected in isolated sequences from COVID-19 patients [49] .",
