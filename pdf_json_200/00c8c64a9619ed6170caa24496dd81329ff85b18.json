Antibody therapy is one way to control infection caused by COVID-19. However, the use of classical antibodies raises complex issues. Heavy chain antibodies (HCAbs) are single-domain antibodies derived from the Camelidae family. The variable part of these antibodies (Nanobodies or VHH) has interesting properties such as small size, cost-effective production, and good tissue permeability, causing VHH to be regarded as an antiviral therapeutics. However, the small size of nanobodies may lead to low antigen binding affinity and rapid renal clearance. In this systematic review, the application of nanobodies in the treatment of COVID-19 infection and other similar infections (MERS and SARS) was reviewed.",

Almost all related sciences are concurrently scrambling to come up with applicable approaches to put out the fire of such crisis.

Likewise, in the fight against COVID-19, antiviral nano-formulated drugs could prevent the replication of viruses, inhibit apoptotic cellular death caused by viruses, or induce an immune reaction against the SARS-CoV-2 infection [6] .

First, the advantage of the Shark VNAR is that in the evolutionary relationship, it is far from mammals on the phylogenetic tree. Owing to the large differences between the two species epitopes, it is possible to produce high affinity and selectivity antibodies against most mammalian antigens in the shark's body. Second, longer CDR3 regions in camel and shark nanobodies lead to higher diversity and improved cryptic epitope detection ability of this type of antibody compared to the classical ones. Third, to maintain the osmotic pressure in seawater, shark blood has a high concentration of urea, causing shark antibodies to be highly resistant to this chaotropic detergent [7, 8] .",

In this study, the effect of nanobody (NbMS10) and nanobody fused to human-FC antibodies on virus pathogenicity was investigated, and these nanobodies showed high affinity to MERS-CoV and potent cross neutralizing activities against different MERS-CoV strains isolated from various hosts.

This study also confirmed a cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-1 S-VHH and SARS-CoV-2 S. These results showed that this VHH was also able to neutralize pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S-like viruses.

In class I nanobodies, Nb6 exhibited the best performance, and the nanobodies could be attached to two RBD domains at the same time. Using the rationally engineered protein, the researchers designed NB6-derived nanobodies in bivalent and trivalent form and examined their functions and affinities. NB6 Nanobody inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values of 2.0-2.4 \u03bcM were determined and its trivalent form with an IC50 of 1.2 nM showed a 2000-fold increase of inhibitory activity on SARS-CoV-2 virus.

After panning against the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, they finally reached 69 unique nanobodies that had good binding with the spike protein, but 15 of them prevented the spike from binding with the cell surface ACE2 receptor. After conducting experiments, the project researchers concluded that combination of some of these nanobodies had synergistic effects on blocking the interaction of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor and increased the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. They used in-silico design via their own signature computer- aided antibody design (CAAD) to design the combination of nanobodies that improve affinity and avidity toward the RBD site of the spike protein and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, they combined the resulting structure with human IgG Fc domains to make high-strength antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

The selected VHHs, with high affinity, bind with the RBD of the viral spike protein. In this study, a camel/human",
