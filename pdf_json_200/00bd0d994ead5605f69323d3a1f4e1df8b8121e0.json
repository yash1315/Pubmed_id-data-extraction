            "text": "Patients with depression are at increased risk for a range of comorbid diseases, with, however, unclear explanations. In this large community-based cohort study of the UK Biobank, 24,130 patients diagnosed with depression were compared to 120,366 matched individuals without such a diagnosis. Follow-up was conducted from 6 months after the index date until death or the end of 2019, for the occurrence of 470 medical conditions and 16 specific causes of death. The median age at the time of the depression diagnosis was 62.0 years, and most of the patients were female (63.63%). During a median follow-up of 4.94 years, 129 medical conditions were found to be significantly associated with a prior diagnosis of depression, based on adjusted Cox regression models. Using disease trajectory network analysis to visualize the magnitude of disease-disease associations and the temporal order of the associated medical conditions, we identified three main affected disease clusters after depression (i.e., cardiometabolic diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, and diseases related to tobacco abuse), which were further linked to a wider range of other conditions. In addition, we also identified three depression-mortality trajectories leading to death due to cardiovascular disease, respiratory system disease and malignant neoplasm. In conclusion, an inpatient diagnosis of depression in later life is associated with three distinct network-based clusters of medical conditions, indicating alterations in the cardiometabolic system, chronic status of inflammation, and tobacco abuse as key pathways to a wide range of other conditions downstream. If replicated, these pathways may constitute promising targets for the health promotion among depression patients.",

Longitudinal studies have reported elevated risks of asthma [5, 6, 11] , diabetes [7, 13] , cardiovascular disease [8, 12] , Parkinson's disease [9] , and dementia [10] among individuals diagnosed with depression. More recently, an increased risk of up to 30 different medical conditions and mortality following a mood disorder diagnosis (including depression) has been reported using data from the national register of Denmark [14] [15] [16] . Furthermore, a causal link has been suggested between depression and multiple disease outcomes through Mendelian Randomization analyses of the UK Biobank participants [17] and other populations [18, 19] . Hence, interventions to prevent future health declines are crucial for patients with depression, in addition to the psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy to address depressive symptoms. A comprehensive analysis of disease trajectories after a diagnosis of depression might assist the identification of key pathways linking depression with subsequent somatic problems.",

Through visualizing the networks of emerged diseasesstudying the magnitude of disease-disease associations and the temporal order of such associations, the analysis provides a foundation for examining causal relationships and sequential patterns of multiple morbidities. To date, disease trajectory analysis has been applied successfully in studies on the identification of sequential diseases, in general, or after a diagnosis of a specific medical condition, such as breast cancer [21, 22] . However, applications of this approach to explore patterns of disease networks after a specific psychiatric disorder are scarce.",

The females with depression had a higher relative risk for obesity, alcohol abuse, sleep disorder, heart failure, chronic ischemic heart disease, and chronic rheumatic heart disease. Male patients with depression had a higher relative risk for sepsis, malnutrition, anxiety, hypothyroid conditions, functional dyspepsia, Table 1 shows the HRs and 95% CIs). In the disease trajectory analysis, female and male depression patients had several common trajectories ( Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Tables 4, 5 ). In addition, although both groups died from malignant neoplasms and respiratory system diseases, different progression pathways were found between the male and female patients ( Supplementary Fig. 6 , Supplementary  Tables 6, 7) . The subgroup PheWAS for the different follow-up periods revealed associations of almost identical diseases with depression both during the first 5 years of follow-up and thereafter (Supplementary Table 8 ). Similarly, stratified analysis by season rendered largely similar estimates as those of the main analysis (Supplementary Table 9 ). In sensitivity analyses, we obtained largely similar Phe-WAS results when excluding depression patients who had a history of any disease that belonged to the same category of the outcome disease (Supplementary Table 10 ). Also, restricting the analyses to individuals without any inpatient record of a somatic disease during the 6 months before the index date did not change the results of the main analyses substantially (Supplementary Table 11 ). When using only the primary diagnoses (n = 1920, 7.96%) from the UK Biobank inpatient hospital data to identify depression, we found 141 out of 470 tested medical conditions to be associated with a prior diagnosis of depression. Compared with the results of the main analysis, 111 (86.05%) significant medical conditions were identified in both analyses, although differential HRs were observed in 20 of these conditions (Supplementary Table 12 ).",

In addition, we observed similar disease trajectories among males and females with depression.

Notably, in addition to consistently reported associations with many common diseases, novel relationships between depression and subsequent individual diseases with relatively low incidence, such as sepsis, visual disturbances/ blindness, and urolithiasis, were also unraveled in our analyses. More recently, a disease trajectory browser has been developed based on national data from inpatient wards, outpatient clinics, and emergency room visits between 1994 and 2018 in Denmark [22] . By searching for depression (ICD-10: F32) using the browser, some of the key diseases, such as cardiometabolic diseases, identified as occurring more-than-expected subsequent to depression in our study were found to occur more-than-expected prior to depression. These results should, however, not be compared directly because in our study we aimed to visualize physiological changes after depression by studying a cohort of patients with depression whereas the Danish work examined diseases occurring both before and after depression (and any other disease) by analyzing the entire general population of Denmark. Therefore, the inconsistent results observed between these two studies do not necessarily invalidate each other. Moreover, using Mendelian Randomization, a previous study has demonstrated causal links between depression and 20, out of 42, phenotypically associated medical conditions [17] . Given that those conditions largely overlap with the key medical conditions identified in the three disease trajectory clusters in our study, results of such analysis corroborate our findings that there are key pathways linking depression to a general health decline.",

Also, Mendelian Randomization analyses have suggested a causal association between depression and ischemic heart disease and lipid metabolism, independent of shared environmental and behavioral factors or medication use [17] [18] [19] . Other possible underlying mechanisms include sympathetic activation, hypothalamic-pituitary activation, and the chronic status of inflammation observed among individuals with depression, which may accelerate the development or progression of cardiometabolic diseases [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] .

Likewise, a recent Mendelian randomization analysis provided evidence supporting a causal link between depression and asthma and osteoarthrosis [17] . As these diseases have key inflammatory mechanisms in common, the observed associations support the notion that depression may lead to exaggerated or prolonged inflammatory responses, as reported in the research literature on both animals and humans [45] .

By illustrating a whole picture of temporal disease progression patterns, this discovery-driven analysis complements association analysis in earlier studies often studying a single disease pair with a specific hypothesis. However, the nature of this analytic strategy prevents us from discovering novel disease pairs involving rare medical conditions. Additional targeted studies, are therefore, needed to examine rarer comorbidities of depression, as a complement to the present approach. Regardless, the disease-trajectory approach provides important additional data to the existing literature by clarifying the clusters and the temporal order of these subsequent diseases. The identification of common disease networks can on the other hand assist in the exploration of key physiological pathways, leading to a general health decline after depression. Other strengths include the use of a large community-based cohort, where complete data for diseases diagnoses were collected prospectively, through linkages with national health registers.",

            "text": "Notable limitations include the lack of primary care data, which may have led to the exclusion of less severe medical conditions in our analyses. Furthermore, the completeness and accuracy of the observed disease trajectory networks may have been impacted the relatively limited follow-up period of the present study (i.e., the median follow-up time was 4.94 years after excluding the first 6 months of follow-up). Additional studies with longer follow-up are needed to investigate diseases with a later onset, such as neurodegenerative diseases, to obtain a more comprehensive picture of disease trajectories subsequent to depression. However, because the findings of the present study did not differ significantly during the first 5 years after the diagnosis of depression and beyond, such truncations of data are unlikely to have a significant influence on the validity of the present results. Notably, although we aimed to explore physiological changes subsequent to depression, the disease trajectory analysis does not, by itself, provide a sufficient basis for causal inference, while lends support to causal relationships indicated elsewhere [17] [18] [19] . Yet, the observed disease patterns might also be explained by the shared etiological factors between depression and these conditions, including genetics, lifestyle, and other environmental factors. Future exploration of disease trajectories by level of genetic susceptibility to depression could be valuable. Although similar estimates were obtained in the sensitivity analyses after excluding depression patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of disease in the same category as the outcome disease and individuals with an inpatient record of a somatic disease during the 6 months prior to the index date (indicating a limited effect of pre-existing somatic comorbidities), we cannot rule out the possibility that these comorbidities contributed to the disease trajectories observed after depression. In addition, it is important to note that patients with depression in this study were identified through inpatient care (likely exhibiting a severe form of the disease) and had a median age of 62 years at the time of ascertainment, which is different from the median age of the diagnosis of depression in the general population. Further, separate analysis of patients with multiple episodes of depression was not feasible due to the limited number of cases. Therefore, disease trajectories after milder versions of depression, depression diagnosed at a younger age, or recurrent depression should be examined in future studies. Last, in a time sequential analysis, it is challenging to investigate how time-varying confounders, such as behavioral factors and life experience, for which we had little information about would have contributed to the observed disease networks.",
