In order not to have our results influenced by differences in CD46 expression levels we first performed flow cytometry analysis to analyze the relative expression levels of the different CD46 isoforms. We observed a highly similar expression level of all isoforms except for the BC2 isoform that was expressed to a level ca 50% lower than the other isoforms ( Fig. S1 A) . HAdV-D56 transduced CHO cells expressing all isoforms better than the control cell line (Fig. S1 B) . After normalization of isoform expression levels to that of BC1, we observed that HAdV-D56 transduced C2-expressing cells most efficient and BC1-expressing cells least efficient ( Fig. S1 B) , a pattern that was different from that of the HAdV-C5/F35 vector, which transduced C1-expressing cells less efficient as compared to cells expressing the other isoforms. From these results we concluded that HAdV-D56 uses CD46 as a cellular receptor, and prefers the C2 isoform.",

With this in mind, we crystallized the knob of HAdV-D56 and determined the structure to investigate what these changes means in relation to the orientation of exposed loops. Crystals of the HAdV-D56 fiber knob were obtained by sitting drop vapour diffusion and a structure was determined to a resolution of 1.38\u00c5 using molecular replacement (Table S1) . Interestingly, all loops involved in interactions with CD46 are severely distinct from HAdV-B11, and HAdV-B7, thus preventing or at least weakening the interaction with CD46 ( Fig. S2 H) . Together this support that the binding mechanism differs from known CD46binding HAdVs and likely explain why studies performed to date have failed to determine an interaction between HAdV-D fiber knobs and CD46 (5).",

The superimposition clearly shows that the HAdV-D56 knob has a drastically different surface loop structure compared to the CD46-binding HAdV-B7 and HAdV-B11 knobs, and is therefore not expected to bind CD46.
