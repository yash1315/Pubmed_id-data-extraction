            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to restriction of hospitalizations and unprecedented redeployment of healthcare resources. The management of IBD has been highly impacted. [1] [2] [3] [4] On the one hand, hospital admissions of IBD patients should be limited to reduce the risks of coronavirus transmission between hospitalized patients and to ensure that there is inpatient capacity to look after the many admissions with COVID-19. 5 On the other hand, delaying hospitalization of IBD patients with severe or complicated disease may increase the risk of poor outcomes. Surgery is also seriously impacted in the present context. 6, 7 A number of emergencies require surgery in the short term, and delaying surgery in some cases may increase the risk of disease progression, post-operative morbidity and disease complications. Performance of endoscopic procedures is also impacted, with significant delays to routine endoscopy. 8 IBD patients do not appear to have an increased risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. 2, 9 However, IBD patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have a higher risk of poor outcomes than the general population. 10 This increased risk may be driven by concomitant medications, especially corticosteroids, but may also be associated with gastrointestinal inflammation, IBD itself or associated comorbidities. Additional risk factors for poor outcomes A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t Manuscript Doi: 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjaa150 from COVID-19 include older age, pre-existing cardiovascular and respiratory disease, obesity, diabetes and cigarette smoking. 11 While the use of immunosuppressing medications such as thiopurines, and biologics has been associated with increased risks of a range of infections in IBD patients, at this point, there is no evidence that IBD patients with COVID have worse outcomes if they receive these drugs. 10, 12, 13 National and international societies, including IOIBD, have recommended the maintenance of these therapies in the present context. 14 Which IBD drugs should be preferentially used to induce response or remission in patients with active IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic is unclear. There is even less evidence on how IBD patients with active disease should be treated according to their COVID-19 infectious status.",

These recommendations, based on our limited current knowledge on COVID-19, will be updated over time according to a better knowledge of the disease.
