Inflammation could activate neutrophils and their extracellular trap formation to promote tumor development (Albrengues et al., 2018) . Tumor development and progression can also induce inflammation. Neutrophils and CRP are inflammatory marker. Elevated levels of neutrophil counts and CRP may also play a causal role in the pathogenesis of cancer (Allin and Nordestgaard, 2011) . It has been reported that in patients infected with COVID-19, some functionally activated neutrophils can form neutrophil extracellular traps, may contributing to organ damage and mortality (Barnes et al., 2020) . Meanwhile, excessive neutrophil extracellular traps formation can trigger a cascade of inflammatory reactions that promotes cancer cell metastasis, destroys surrounding tissues, and results in permanent organ damage (Jorch and Kubes, 2017; Papayannopoulos, 2018) . Therefore, we believe that pro-inflammatory neutrophils, that is, functionally activated neutrophils, have a powerful function of promoting inflammation and causing organ damage. Moreover, COVID-19 as an acute inflammatory disease. Due to coronavirus infection, monocytes and macrophages secrete large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators such as CRP and IL-6. This can trigger cytokine release syndrome, which causes ARDS to cause death (Moore and June, 2020) .",

Second, we did not consider enough risk factors to establish a risk assessment model and have not fully considered the unmeasured confounding factors.

Pro-inflammatory neutrophils and CRP can be used as independent predictors of the severity and the adverse clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Moreover, compared with COVID-19 patients without cancer, cancer patients with COVID-19 have higher neutrophil counts and CRP levels. Therefore, proinflammatory neutrophils and CRP play a greater adverse role in patients with COVID-19 cancer, as a mediator to accelerate the interaction of cancer and COVID-19, and promote the occurrence of \"cytokine storm\", which may be COVID-19 causes of critical illness and adverse clinical outcomes in cancer patients with COVID-19. During the outbreak of COVID-19, wo need to be more alert to the levels of pro-inflammatory neutrophils and CRP after cancer patients infected with COVID-19, so as to better give corresponding treatment measures.",

The median or mean of common biochemical indicators of cancer patients with COVID-19 was within the normal reference value range, 127.50-173.50]), white blood cell count, \u00d7109/L (5.88,]), neutrophil count, \u00d7109/L (3.95, IQR [2.73-6.04]), monocyte count, \u00d7109/L (0.42, IQR [0.29-0.63]), aspartate aminotransferase, U/L (30.00, IQR [20.00-47.50]), alanine aminotransferase, U/L (25.00, IQR [18.00-40.00]), alkaline phosphatase, U/L, (77.00, IQR [66.00-114.00]), creatinine, 41.00-93.00]), Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L (230.00, IQR [187.00-353.00]), CK-MB, ng/ml (0.70, IQR [0.40-1.38]), and troponin I, ng/L (5.05, IQR [2.20-12.88]). The erythrocyte count, \u00d71012/L (3.77, IQR [3.21-4.09]), hemoglobin count, g/L (114.00, IQR [102.00-128.00]), and lymphocyte count, \u00d7109/L (0.99, IQR [0.68-1.56]) are all below the lower limit of the reference value. However, the D-dimer, mg/L (0.92, IQR [0.22-2.39]), and C-reactive protein (CRP), mg/L (35.10, IQR [5.68-81.90]) were significantly higher than the upper limit of the reference value interval. Moreover, in the detection of immune-related factors, the median value of IL-6, pg/ml (18.21, IQR [8.07-42.45]) is significantly higher than the upper limit of the reference value interval, and the median or mean value of the remaining factors are within the normal reference value interval, including TNF-\u03b1, pg/ml (2.62, IQR [2.02-3.52]), IL-4, pg/ml (2.26, IQR [1.59-3.32]), IL-2, pg/ml (2.69, IQR [2.37-3.41]), IL-10, pg/ml (4.17, IQR [2.78-5.56]), IFN-\u03b3, pg/ ml (2.15, IQR [1.57-3.27]), CD4/CD8 ratio, (1.70, IQR [1.04-2.37). Like the laboratory parameters of cancer patients with COVID-19, the median expression levels of CRP, mg/L (10.95, IQR [1.55-43.18]), and IL pg/ml  (12.30,]) in COVID-19 patients without cancer were significantly higher than the upper limit of the normal reference range. Relative to the normal reference value range and COIVD-19 patients without cancer, cancer patients with COVID-19 showed a lower erythrocyte count, \u00d710 9 /L (3.88, IQR [3.21-4.09]) and hemoglobin level, \u00d710 9 /L (114.00, IQR [102.00-273.50]), a higher neutrophil count, \u00d710 9 /L (3.95, IQR [2.73-6.04]) and higher levels of CRP, mg/L (35.10,).",
