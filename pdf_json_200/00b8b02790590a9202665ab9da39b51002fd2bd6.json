The study aims to analyze variables associated with the community psychosocial burden (anxiety level) during the co-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Methods: This study collected data (n \u00bc 8,031) online. Psychosocial burden was measured based on the anxiety level which include 5 aspects, such as economic, religious, educational, employment, and social issues. Each question used a Likert scale. Six independent were examined, such as age, gender, religion, marital, education, and employement. In the final stage, a multivariate test was performed using a multinomial logistic regression. Results: Someone older experienced less high anxiety. The age group of 20-29 years was 4,330 times likely to experience higher anxiety than the age group of 50 years. While, those in the age group of 40-49 years weer 2,322 times more likely to have higher anxiety than those in the age group of 50 years. Male respondents had lower possibility of medium to high anxiety than females. Respondents with secondary and lower education had 3,117 times possibilities to experience higher anxiety than those with high education level.",

Table 3 shows the statistical description of respondents' characteristics. It can be seen that the respondents who experienced high anxiety level were dominated by those in the age group of 20-29 years and females. Table 3 informs that the Moslem respondents dominated all anxiety levels. The respondents who have been married dominantly experienced all anxiety levels. From the perspective of education level, those with higher education level were dominantly at all anxiety levels.",
