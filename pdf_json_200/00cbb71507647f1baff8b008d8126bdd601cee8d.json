Initial response to the crisis situation for the pandemic closely mirrored plans for a mass casualty event. By leveraging resources including human and physical, and by dividing our surgeon workforce into micro teams we were able to create a flexible and responsive infrastructure to address the crisis as it unfolded. By adoption of virtual platforms and equal division of labor, surgical resident education was continued. Specific adjustments to the schedule and curriculum for medical students allowed them to continue their studies safely and on schedule. Our model serves as an example by which hospital systems of similar size may utilize principles of mass casualty preparedness to craft their own plan for a future contagion response strategy.",

As clinicians and researchers race to better understand the virus, its biology, and seek effective treatment methods, assumptions must align with the possibility that the demands on our health care systems may only escalate. The virusrelated mortality count continues to rise; the total number of infections, as well as the resultant morbidity, may never be fully known and health care systems on a global scale have been strained to crisis level magnitudes. Mass casualty training has provided hospital systems a framework of experience and parallel processes in terms of resource utilization, closed communication loops, supply chain assessment, and patient triage strategies. However, the acutely injured patient surge seen with mass casualties is distinct from the acutely ill and highly infectious patient surge as the latter places the workforce at risk. While the difficulties of meeting the demands of COVID-19-related patient surges include, but are not limited to, access to ventilators, lack of intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability, and shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), an additional concern is maintaining and training a healthy workforce.",

The importance of preparation and planning became evident as reports of the highly infectious nature of COVID-19 came into global awareness in early 2020. As we braced for our surge of COVID-19-related cases, we developed an operational strategy to maintain patient care teams while limiting risk and exposure of our residents and staff. Through insulating our care delivery groups, our aim was to avoid illness and therefore serve patients without a critical workforce shortage.

In-house duties consisted of inpatient rounds on all general surgery inpatients, all new patient consults including floor and emergency center (EC), all new patient trauma consults, trauma code activations, and assistance with bedside rounding responsibilities the following morning. At the completion of each call shift, the exiting team would provide a detailed handoff to the oncoming team through a virtual platform. Members of each of these teams were asked to socially distance when not in house and to avoid contact with members of other micro-teams to avoid \"cross contamination\" risks.

The collaboration between residency programs and hospital physician surge planning committee allowed the institution to develop a hospital-wide ICU surge plan. This plan doubled the ICU capacity from approximately 80 ICU beds to a potential 190 ICU beds. While there is no \"1 size fits all\" model or plan for any type of disaster scenario, our tiered, micro-team approach to coverage insulated the workforce, allowed maximal flexibility, and minimal exposure risk all while maintaining high clinical performance standards. Our strategy is scalable in that residents, and midlevel providers can be added to service lines to further improve flexibility to accommodate potential escalating ICU duties or fill workforce gaps if infectious exposures were to occur.",

Indeed, emergency responses to mass casualty events are frequently discussed and practiced at trauma centers on nationwide scale in preparation for events such as shootings, bombings, or natural disasters. In many instances, the underlying principles of a mass casualty response and the systemic response to the current pandemic are similar. Communication, teamwork, patient triage strategies, assessments of supply chains, and resource utilization models are common concepts to both the mass casualty event and the patient surges seen with the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, both occurrences are known to physically and mentally challenge a workforce. However, the contagious nature of COVID-19 creates further challenges when considering protecting our workforce from infection, exhaustion, and burnout. 7 Our experience provides a potential usable model for future responses to surges related to infectious diseases and other crises requiring multiple small teams to function in concert independently. The utilization of a team-based approach limits high-risk exposures, addresses mental and physical health concerns, complies with local and national guidelines and recommendations, propagates medical education, and ensures continued high-quality patient care.",

The surgical attendings' team consisted of the assigned surgical residents(Table 1) and an internal/family medicine resident.

(B) Management of the nontraditional ICUs was modeled after the Society of Critical Care Medicine's Tiered Staffing Strategy.6 Once the patient load required for activation and use 3M-A for patient care, surgical intensivists would cover 2 units in our modified tiered staffing strategy. A surgical attending credentialed in critical care would oversee the nontraditional units and a non-ICU physician (Hospitalists A-C) would work alongside the surgical attending. This would maximize care for the large number of COVID-19 patients in critical condition. (C) Night float assignment for the nontraditional units.
