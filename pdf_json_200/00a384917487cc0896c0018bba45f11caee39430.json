In terms of economic productivity and CO2 emissions, these markets play an important role in the global environment. Hence, to achieve global environmental needs, transition to renewable energy sources is essential. However, financial constraints along with geopolitical risks could act as possible barriers to the required transition. Thereby, in this paper, we aim to assess the impact of financial development and geopolitical risk on renewable energy consumption in emerging markets from 1996 to 2015. A two-step system GMM is tested, revealing a positive significant effect of financial development on transition to renewable energy. Moreover, contrary to the expected negative effect of geopolitical risk, our results reveal significant positive effect of geopolitical risk on renewable energy consumption. We highlight that the effects of both financial development and geopolitical risk are more pronounced in the long run. Finally, imperative policy implications are highlighted.",

However, it also accounts for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Carbon dioxide discharge has increased globally in few years Seetanah et al. 2019) . Emerging markets' fossil fuel combustion obtrusively contribute to these emissions. For instance, according to Climate Watch Data (Historical GHG Emission 2016) statistics, China ranks first in the list of the top 10 emitters from 2006 to 2016 with more that 24% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions alone in 2016. Taking into account other emerging markets, such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, Iran, and Russia, which are also included in the list of top 10 emitters for a decade, they collectively emitted more than 45% of the GHG in 2016. This has serious implications for human beings and the economy (Acheampong 2019; Alshehry and Belloumi 2017; Mezghani and Haddad 2017) . According to Apergis and Garz\u00f3n (2020) , policymakers are committed to design policies and take national initiatives which help in reducing the adverse impacts of GHG emissions on global environment.",

Indeed, the renewable energy sector demands diverse funding sources; for example, Zhang et al. (2016) argue that equity financing is appropriate for technology related small projects, whereas nuclear energyrelated mega ventures need debt financing from banks. Hence, transitioning to renewable energy sources cannot be accomplished without a well-developed financial system.

Hence, we still lack a clear understanding of the dynamics of this relationship for emerging markets that disproportionately contribute to GHG emissions worldwide. According to United Nations report, the lack of international support has made less developed economies at risk to the Covid-19 pandemic (UN 2020). Additionally, with the ongoing health crisis, it would be even harder to mobilize external funding or technical transformation to support cleaner energy plans in those countries (Barbier and Burgess 2020) . In absence of foreign external financial support, emerging and developing economies are in ever higher need of finding domestic innovative financing solutions.

Caldara and Iacoviello (2018) define geopolitical risks as the risks associated with armed fights, terrorism, and state-to-state conflicts which impact regular and diplomatic level international affairs. Geopolitical risks create an atmosphere of uncertainty and unrest. This uncertainty drives firms to put their future plans on hold which reduce current production to their minimum capacity in anticipation of lower consumption. This dimension has been used by Carney (2016) along with economic and policy instability proxies to discuss the adverse economic consequences of this triad of instability. Major players of economic activities (bankers, equity market traders, and industrialists) believe that geopolitical risks change the dynamics of capital markets and slow the decision-making speed of investors (Caldara and Iacoviello 2018) . Furthermore, geopolitical risk is a two-sided sword for economy, on one side it may adjourn consumers' usage, and on the other side it stops companies from making investments in an attempt to maintain a minimum level of protective savings (Bloom 2009 ). Hence, it is argued that geopolitical risks are lead indicators to economic and business swings.",

Considering the significance of GPR and its impact on investment plans, production rate, and overall economy, we aim to extend the literature by investigating the impact of FD and geopolitical risk on the REC in a sample of 19 emerging markets for a time period of 20 years from 1996. In our analysis, we consider several proxies of FD (from banking sector and capital markets) and the novel GPR index of Caldara and Iacoviello (2018) alongside macroeconomic controls. Our empirical strategy involves adopting the two-step system GMM to control for endogeneity problems, which are a common phenomenon in such studies. Furthermore, we complement our analyses by computing the long run elasticities for the main variables of interest (financial development, geopolitical risks).",

Firstly, the current study addresses the importance of renewable energy consumption in the context of emerging economies and emphasizes how enhancements in renewable energy consumption helps emerging economies fulfill their responsibilities in combating climate challenges. Secondly, we discuss the role of financial development on renewable energy consumption which not only enhances the FD-REC literature but helps policymakers of emerging countries in designing realistic energy transition plans without affecting their production targets. Thirdly, considering the uncertain political situation of most of emerging markets, the present study reveals how geopolitical risks, as proxied for by the novel GPR index, also impact the consumption of renewable energy in these countries. Our last contribution resides in the study sample and methodology, namely, a comprehensive inclusion of 19 emerging economies for a period spanning 20 years (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) using a two-step system GMM model.",

Kutan et al.

Considering the importance of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Hassine and Harrathi (2017) have analyzed the FD-REC nexus in this region and found a significantly positive correlation between financial development and renewable energy consumption.",

Panel data-fixed effect model of their study provides results which confirm that usage of renewable energy depends upon income level, energy rates, financial development, and FDI.

Moreover, such circumstances result in capital outflows because when violence prevails in emerging economy, then investors shift their capital to other developed and politically stable countries which offer secure return on investments.

For example, an important study of Bloom (2009) empirically demonstrates that surprises of uncertainty influence overall demand across real life because of the \"wait and see\" strategy of both producers and consumers. Likewise, Gilchrist et al. (2014) , who analyzed data of uncertainty-facing mixed companies with a quantitative general equilibrium model, reported that due to the irrevocable nature of investments, companies adopt \"wait and see\" strategy in response of upward uncertainty trend. This happens because firms want to hold liquid assets to prevent future insolvency in case of unproductive investments. Literature affirms that uncertainty, irrespective of its nature, generate negative impacts on overall economic and business activities. For example, economic policy uncertainty adversely impacts general business cycle and reduces new investments, employment opportunities, and production level (e.g., see Baker et al. 2016 ). In the same way, Azzimonti (2018) used chronological stats from 1929 to 2013 for the USA and affirmed that in the presence of political uncertainty, private businesses reduce their investments.",

GPR has a negative impact not only on investment; however, economic theory suggests that overall consumption of a country also decreases in prevalence of uncertainty. For instance, Balta et al. (2013) used the European Commission Business and Consumer Survey for all European countries and found that uncertainty significantly reduces both investments and consumption.

(2017) argued that a country's ability to secure the availability of required energy is an important prerequisite for that country's economic development and for the prosperity of people. Hence the positive correlation of geopolitical risks with renewable energy consumption on the bases of energy security is justified on two reasons. On the one hand, existence of higher geopolitical risk in major oil producing countries such as Middle East OPEC members which represent 81% of OPEC production (Petersson and T\u00f6rnquist-Plewa 2008) make them unreliable and uncertain because of political instability. This scenario forces major developing energy consumers such as Brazil, India, and China to reduce their dependence on oil imports and invest in development of renewable energy in order to achieve their energy requirements. On the other hand, major petro-states need to make regular investments to prevent their fossil fuel resources (e.g., pipelines and oil wells) which might be soft target of terrorist attacks. Therefore, instead of bearing higher investments of their non-renewable energy resources, developing oil producers also make investments on development of renewable energy resources. Thus, under pressure of the increasing oil prices and energy insecurity, these developing countries are shifting towards increased generation and consumption of renewable energy to ensure their energy security and development.",

Table 5 reports both short-and long-run elasticity of our main variables of interest, namely, FD and geopolitical risks. Shortrun elasticity values are derived from the linear modeling from model (2) to model (6) of Table 4 . Then, in order to calculate the value of long-run elasticity, we divide the short-run elasticity value with a value obtained by subtracting value of lagged renewable energy consumption coefficient from 1. Model 2 indicates positive elasticity of PCDMB rises from its short run value of (0.186) to its long run value of (1.039). Also, positive short-run and long-run elasticity values of BCBD significantly increase from (0.453) to (2.448). Likewise, positive short-run elasticity value of DCPS (0.436) reaches to (2.435) for the long run. The value of TOR also remains positive and evidences a rise from it short run value of (0.197) to the long-run value of (1.186). Hence, the effect of FD on REC, in our sample of emerging economies, is superior in the long run in comparison to the short run.",

Primarily, policymakers of emerging countries should execute their renewable energy consumption strategies and also FD plans considering the importance of the later for the former, as advantages of renewable energy consumption are multifold. First of all, renewable energy consumption improves the atmosphere. Therefore, emerging markets, which lack separate environment budgets, may decrease air pollution by increasing renewable energy consumption in the country. Discouraging the business level usage of non-renewable may also increase renewable energy consumption. For instance, imposing an air pollution tax on production plants may shift them towards renewable energy consumption. Secondly, the transfer of renewable energy is much easier as compared to non-renewable energy which reduces the energy transfer cost and also security expenses of non-renewable energy reservoirs. Thirdly, renewable energy consumption ensures the continuous availability of required amount of energy.",

They should realize the importance of FD in the energy transition process. A shortsighted and imperative energy transition plan, without availability of required financial resources, may disrupt the production capacity of firms. Thus, governments should progressively enforce renewable energy consumption policies while offering appropriate financial via their financial institutions and/or capital markets. Focusing on the importance of financial development, legislator of emerging economies may introduce some incentive plans, such as easy loans, and tax rebates for businesses which want to enhance the consumption of renewable energy in their production plants. This may encourage businesses not only to enhance renewable energy consumption but also to invest in small projects of renewable energy production to fulfill their own energy demands. Similarly, dedicated incentive schemes should be introduced for investors who wants to invest in mega renewable energy projects. Intricate and lengthy bank credit procedures may daunt renewable energy projects; on the other hand, swift loans, with lower or zero interest rates, may fulfill the financial demands of renewable energy investments. Therefore, for successful execution of energy transition from non-renewable to renewable, governments in developing countries should imply policies that enhance the financial capacity of businesses to invest in renewable energy plants instead of forcing hasty and unrealistic targets of minimizing fossil fuel consumption.",

Furthermore, due to data availability of our study sample, we considered 20-year period spanning from 1996 to 2015. Another potential extension of the current study is to incorporate more recent data once available, and including the direct and indirect impact of Covid-19, through technology transformation, R&D, investments, etc. Additionally, we provided two possible explanations of the positive impact of geopolitical risk; scholars could extend the current paper by qualitatively addressing the issue.",
