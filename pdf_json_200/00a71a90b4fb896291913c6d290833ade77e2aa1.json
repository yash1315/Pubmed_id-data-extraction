Novel coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has infected about 3 million people worldwide and killed more than 200,000, most being the elderly or people with potential chronic diseases or in immunosuppressive states. According to big data analysis, there are many proteins homologous to or interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which, therefore, may not be the only receptor for the novel coronavirus; other receptors may also exist in host cells of different species. These potential receptors may also play an important role in the infection process of the novel coronavirus. The current study aimed to discover such key proteins or receptors and analyze the susceptibility of different animals to the novel coronavirus, in order to reveal the transmission process of the virus in cross-species infection. We analyzed the proteins coded by the ACE2 gene in different mammalian species and predicted their correlation and homology with the human ACE2 receptor. The major finding of our predictive analysis suggested ACE2 gene-encoded proteins to be highly homologous across mammals. Based on their high homology, their possibility of binding the spike-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is quite high and species such as Felis catus, Bos taurus, Rattus norvegicus etc. may be potential susceptible hosts; special monitoring is particularly required for livestock that are in close contact with humans. Our results might provide ideas for the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus pneumonia.",

Over 5,000 viruses have been identified to date, of which \u223c75% are of a zoonotic origin, and can cross the species barrier and establish infection in human beings (1) . Since December 2019, multiple cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause had been reported, which was subsequently identified as an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus infection, i.e., coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2) . Based on the results of genome comparisons, this novel coronavirus was named \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and was considered the primary pathogen of the current outbreak (3) . The frequent and occasional regional outbreaks and uncertain epidemics have triggered serious social panic and caused huge economic losses, as the disease gradually spread globally. A previous study revealed the potential relationship between infection and history of contact with seafood and wildlife markets at the early stage (4) . However, the source of SARS-CoV-2 has not been conclusively identified yet, since some patients did not have a history of exposure to wildlife markets at all.",

            "text": "Previous studies had documented infection from coronaviruses in humans, pigs, cattle, sheep, birds, dogs, cats, mice, camels, bats, and whales (5) . Some hosts can be seriously infected with various coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the \u03b2-coronavirus genus of the family Coronaviridae. The coronaviruses infecting human beings at present had originated from animals, and their natural hosts are generally Chiroptera (bats) and rodents (rats) (6) . Additionally, different types of coronavirus can also infect Artiodactyla, including livestock (pigs, cattle, and camels), and carnivorous intermediate hosts, such as minks and civets (7) . Whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect livestock (pigs and birds) and pets (such as dogs) is not yet clear. At present, there is insufficient understanding of the host-adaptive mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, including the process of virus infection and replication, the function of virus coding proteins, interaction between the virus and its host factors, activation of the innate antiviral immune response of host, and the mechanism of viral escape from the host's immune system. Moreover, there is a lack of available approaches to deal with sudden viral infection events, to effectively target specific molecules to inhibit viral infection, and to treat the infection-related complications. In addition, with the source of the pathogen still being unclear, it significantly restricts extensive study and tracking of the route of transmission. Advancements in novel technologies could provide a new method to trace the source of the virus. Specifically, the possibility of suspect animals as intermediate hosts can be evaluated based on the binding characteristics of the viral proteins with different receptors. New technologies, such as artificial intelligence and shared data, are available for epidemiological investigation, thereby contributing to improved accuracy and screening efficiency.",

It can catalyze the conversion of decapeptide angiotensin (Ang) I to octapeptide Ang II, and hydrolyze bradykinin by removing a C-terminal dipeptide (9) . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), discovered as a homolog of ACE, functions as a carboxypeptidase that can preferentially cleave hydrophobic or basic amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. It can catalyze the conversion of Ang II to Ang-(1-7) and degrade Ang I to the inactive Ang-(1-9) (10). Ang- (1-7) is a vasodilator peptide with antioxidant, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory properties (11) . ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, kidneys, testis, hepatobiliary duct, and alveolar type 2 cells (12) . Previous studies had predicted the structure of the spike-protein of SARS-CoV-2, and revealed it as a key protein that mediated virus invasion into host cells, interacted with ACE2 proteins, and mediated infection in humans (13) .",

Results indicated a high possibility of ACE2 binding to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 based on high homology (Figure 2) . Superposition of the structural model of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD complexed with ACE2/ACE from human, Nyctereutes procyonoides (Raccoon dog), Neophocaena asiaeorientalis (Finless porpoise), and Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese rufous horseshoe bat) showed the complexes to have highly similar overall structures (Figure 2A) . By analyzing the interacting residues between S-RBD and ACE2/ACE from different species in these complexes, two interacting regions (residues 19-84 and 346-360) were identified in ACE2/ACE. The sequences of these two regions from the species analyzed were found to be highly conserved ( Figure 2B) . However, the interaction interfaces between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2/ACE from different species in these complex structures were slightly different, with the ACE2 from humans having the maximum number of interacting residues, and being the largest buried area across the species (Figures 2C-F) . This suggested ACE2 from humans could have a have higher affinity to SARS-CoV-2 S-RDB than those from other species.",
