Hence, we assessed the impact of dental pain, fear of COVID-19 and psychological distress during lockdown on the oral health related quality of life of individuals visiting a tertiary dental care center during COVID-19 pandemic. Cross sectional study conducted among patients between 18-60 years. Demographics, access to pain killers, dental care (yes/no), duration (</> 15 days) and intensity of pain were self reported. Fear of COVID-19 was assessed using fear of corona virus scale (FCV-19S); psychological distress in the last 30 days and oral health related quality of life was evaluated. Oral examination was performed and dental caries status (DMFT) was assessed using the world health organization method. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was conducted to evaluate significant predictors and 5% was set as level of significance. 2966 patients visited our dental emergency due to painful decayed tooth between March-June 2020. Mean age was 42.7 years, 53.97% were males and most common cause of painful teeth was upper right third molar (7.7%). 73.4% reported lack of pain medication; 95% reported closure of dental clinics close to home. Almost 79% suffered from dental pain for more than 15 days. Higher self reported pain (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.36-14.71), >15 days of suffering from pain (OR 6.8; 95% CI 2.18-23.14), greater fear of COVID-19 (OR 4.14; 95% CI 1.98-16.07) and psychological distress (OR 4.41; 95% CI 1.09-16.76) were associated with poorer OHRQOL of adults during COVID-19 pandemic.

India, enforced complete lockdown from March 2020 to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost all dental clinics were closed in Chennai city to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV2 as aerosol generating procedures were strictly prohibited. COVID-19 has caused world wide panic and fear known as 'coronaphobia' due to unpredictable nature of the disease causing mental distress in common people (Asmundson and Taylor, 2020) . Further, stress of lockdown and isolation can lead to mental disorders such as anxiety and depression (Zhou et al., 2020) , and dental pain could have worsened the situation. All these circumstances can affect an individual's overall health, hence, we assessed the impact of dental pain, fear of COVID-19 and psychological distress during lockdown on the oral health related quality of life of individuals visiting a tertiary dental care center during COVID-19 pandemic.",

Sample size was estimated with the power of the study at 80%, level of significance set at 5% and the prevalence ratio of 1.55 yielded a sample size of 2452. Every patient who visited our tertiary center for emergency was approached to participate in this study.

Access to pain killers in pharmacies (yes/no), access to dental care close to home (yes/no), duration of pain in days (</> 15 days), demographics (age, sex, annual family income) were also recorded. Fear of COVID-19 was assessed using fear of corona virus scale 3 (FCV-19S); its a seven-item questionnaire with response rated on a five-item likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree and the score ranges from 7-35; higher scores indicating grater fear of COVID-19 (Ahorsu et al., 2020) .",

Reliability of the questionnaires was assessed among 40 individuals randomly using test-retest and intra-class correlation was found to be greater than 0.80 for all three scales. Fear of COVI19, psychological distress, DMFT scores and OHRQOL was dichotomized into high and low based on the median scores. Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA).

Previously, the psychological distress during the East Japan earth quake and giant tsunami negatively impacted the OHRQOL; further, upper middle age adults and those with oral problems had poorer OHRQOL (Kishi et al., 2015) . COVID-19 has caused greater damage in terms of psychological distress as people are locked inside their homes for several days without access to care. Regression analysis showed that greater fear of COVID-19 and psychological distress were significantly related with poorer OHRQOL. However, it is surprising that psychological factors were significantly associated with OHRQOL but annual family income was not as lower socio-economic status is associated with poor OHRQOL. This finding is in contrary to previous reports reported during ordinary situations (Zaitsu et al., 2011) , but COVID-19 is unique. The relationship between oral health status and psychological problems has been ambiguous (Amarasena et al., 2015) , but our findings support this relationship.",
