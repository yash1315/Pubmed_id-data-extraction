Most recently, COVID-19 has triggered anxiety, and measures to contain the virus have caused uncertainty, isolation, and economic despair, which take their toll on mental health. Health professionals who care for patients during these crises are vulnerable not only to infection, but also to psychological distress, as population morbidity and deaths, and demand for health services increase [3, 4] . Unique stressors for health professionals include burnout [5] and moral injury [6] , and are exacerbated by shortages of medical supplies and health services during a time of unprecedented need [7] . Yet despite the need for mental health supports for patients, the general public, and people working in health care, health professionals have received little or no training in providing mental health care during pandemics [8] . Health professionals are asking for reassurance that their organizations will support them, do everything possible to protect them, and provide medical and social support if they or their families become infected [9] . The general public is asking that the health care system be a source of support for maintaining and restoring mental health in the midst of a pandemic [10] .

Both studies found high rates of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress using the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. For example, 70% of respondents reported psychological distress [24] . Psychological distress varied by gender (higher for women), health profession (higher for nurses), and level of exposure to COVID-19 (higher for those working in the epicenter of the pandemic) [23, 24] . Higher rates of symptoms were also found in a third study that (continued on next page) used a different set of assessment tools (Symptom Checklist 90, Selfrating Depression and Anxiety Scales, and Post-traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian).

Some evidence suggests that delays in receiving mental health interventions result in higher rates of baseline negative psychological symptoms.

In one of these studies, there were no differences in baseline anxiety and depression symptoms between those holding roles with high versus low risk of exposure to infection [25] .

The first was a qualitative study that involved interviews with psychological first aid trainers, trainees, and administrators in Sierra Leone and Liberia [29] . Implementation relied on training non-specialists to deliver the intervention.
