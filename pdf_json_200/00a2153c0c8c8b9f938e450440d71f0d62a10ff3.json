Our experiments do not use polymeric crowding agents to induce LLPS which we believe may have more impacts on droplets beyond simple shifting the phase diagram. Therefore, our dilute concentrations result in few droplets. Hence, we have no reason to be concerned that the small amount of fluorescent protein inhibits LLPS and we have performed these experiments in the past examining each RBP phase separation (Ryan et al Mol Cell 2018, Burke et al Mol Cell 2015, Conicella et al Structure 2016) and have also used this approach to evaluate partitioning (Ryan et al biorxiv 2020). We have added source data of these images with larger fields of view with multiple small droplets that interested readers can examine with high magnification. We appreciate the reviewer's insight and we do agree that the lack of partitioning of MBP-N into FUS LC droplets may have more to do with MBP interactions with (or difficultly partitioning into) FUS LC than with N interactions with FUS LC, so we have clarified comments suggesting a FUS LC / N difference to explicitly make this clear. It is possible that N can promote phase separation of RBPs but it is not trivial to perform these experiments (indeed we are still working on developing and optimizing a precise approach to do this) and so we have not attempted to ask this question here.
