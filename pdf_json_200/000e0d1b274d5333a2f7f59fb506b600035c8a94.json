To protect the privacy of research participants while using their DDPs for scientific research, we developed de-identification software that is able to handle typical characteristics of DDPs such as regularly changing file structures, visual and textual content, different file formats, different file structures and accounting for usernames.

            "text": "To protect privacy of research participants while using DDPs for scientific research, different types of security measures should be taken such as using shielded (cloud)environments to store the data and using privacy-preserving algorithms when analyzing the data. One key issue here is that the privacy of the participants should be preserved while their data is investigated by researchers and that, although appropriate security measures are taken to prevent this, in case of a data breach, it should not be possible to identify research participants. Because of these reasons, a thorough de-identification procedure is imperative. Many different types of software are already available for this, such as DEDUCE (Menger, Scheepers, van Wijk, & Spruit, 2018) and 'de-identify Twitter' (Coppersmith, Mitchell, Harman, Dredze, & Leary, 2017) . However, existing methods are not able to handle the highly complex and unstructured nature of DDPs. A particular characteristic of DDPs, that a de-identification procedure should consider, is the fact that the primary identifier of a natural person can be different for different DDPs and is often a username. Furthermore, some DDPs store private interactions of research participants with their contacts, which should be de-identified as well. At last, in case of personal data protected by the GDPR, 'machine readable' unfortunately does not mean equally structured nor easy to parse. Due to this great variety in content and structure, a new method for de-identification of DDPs is essential.",

The most straightforward cause is that the data subject generated additional data throughout this month. However, other important factors also play a role. First, data controllers can develop new features by which new types of data regarding the data subject are collected. Second, other features are phased out. Third, some data (for example search history) is only saved for a limited amount of time and is destroyed by the data controller after that period. In that case, it will also not be present in the DDP anymore.

Instagram DDPs come as one or multiple zipfiles (depending on the amount of data available on the data subject). The .zip-file contains a number of folders in which all the visual content is stored, namely \"photos\", \"videos\", \"profile\" and \"stories\". The different folders refer to the different Instagram features used by the data subject to generate the visual content. For example, in the folder \"profile\", a subject's profile picture can be found, while in the folder \"stories\", visual content can be found generated using the \"stories\" feature in Instagram, a form of ephemeral sharing. All textual information is collected in a number of .json files. Some of these files have a simple list structure. For example the file \"likes.json\" lists all the 'likes' given by the subject, supplemented with a timestamp and the username of the Instagram account to which the 'like' was given. Files such as 'connections.json', 'searches.json' and 'seen content.json' have similar structures. Other files, such as 'profile.json' are typically shorter in size but have a more complex structure, as they typically contain different auxiliary characteristics. Other files with such a structure are for example 'account history.json', 'devices.json' and 'settings.json'. However, a substantial number of files contains data that is less structured. Examples of such files are 'comments.json', 'media.json', 'messages.json' and 'stories activities.json'. Furthermore, data subjects at Instagram are not necessarily natural persons. Data subjects at Instagram can be identified by a single and unique Username. Typically, natural persons have individual accounts with an accompanying username, but other institutions, such as for example retail shops or bands can also have an individual account with an accompanying username.",

However, direct personal data is less likely to be relevant for the research.

            "text": "To remove direct personal data from DDPs, the software should be able to adhere to the five key characteristics of DDPs introduced in the previous subsection. A first step is to investigate to what extent existing software and literature is able to remove direct personal data from DDPs. A well-known approach is k\u2212anonymity (Sweeney, 2002) which requires that each record in a dataset is similar to at least k \u2212 1 other records on the potentially identifying variables (El Emam & Dankar, 2008) . However, parts of the DDPs are highly unstructured and thereby unique per DDP and reaching k\u2212anonymity is therefore not feasible. Much research has focused on the deidentification of electronic health records, for example to enable their use in multi-center research studies (Kushida et al., 2012) . Scientific open source de-identification tools are available such as DEDUCE (Menger et al., 2018) as well as commercial tools, such as Amazon Comprehend (Simon, 2018) and CliniDeID (Liu, Perez-Concha, Nguyen, Bennett, & Jorm, 2020) (Heider, Obeid, & Meystre, 2020) . Similar initiatives have taken place to de-identify personal data in other types of data, such as for human resource purposes (van Toledo, van Dijk, & Spruit, n.d.). However, textual content generated from structured data-bases such as for electronic health records or human resources typically have a higher level of structure compared to DDPs and does not handle key identifying information in DDPs, such as usernames or visual content and therefore existing software was not sufficient for our purpose. Alternatively, software has been developed focusing on the removal of usernames, for example for Twitter data (Coppersmith et al., 2017) . Furthermore, many different types of both open source and commercial software are available to identify and blur faces on images and videos, such Microsoft Azure (Azure, 2021) , and Facenet-PyTorch (Esler, 2019) .

The developed software aims for such a level of protection that the privacy of the DDP owners (the participants) is always preserved. Importantly, the goal is not to prepare the DDPs for public sharing, however, in the unlikely event of a data breach, the individual research participants should not be directly identifiable. Therefore, the de-identification procedure introduced here should always be supplemented with other security measures such as using a shielded (cloud)environment to store the data and using privacy-preserving algorithms when analyzing the data.",

This way, not all occurrences will be added to the dictionary, increasing its size and reducing the efficiency (during the deidentification phase (see below), the algorithm needs to look for each key separately). Instead, by only adding the search patterns to the dictionary, the de-identification process remains efficient and becomes more inclusive. An important side note is that the regular expressions will only look for Instagram URLs. This because most of the URLs in the DDPs represent links to public websites.

Additionally, it is also possible to provide the algorithm with a list of (user)names (and/or other information) and specific their corresponding codes yourself. This might be interesting for scientific research in which the (user)names of participants need to be (clearly) distinguishable from other (user)names.

As the determination of whether a face is defined identifiable or not is performed by a human rater and this distinction is sometimes not straightforward, the questionable cases are independently rated by two raters and classification is performed based on consensus. In addition, a set of 100 .JPEG files and 20 .MP4 files were independently annotated by two separate annotators. On the .JPEG files, 204 faces were identified and from these, 193 were identified by both raters, which equals 94.6%. On this subset, a Cohen's \u03ba inter-rater reliability was calculated of 1, so the raters highly agreed on which faces were appropriately de-identified and which not. For the .MP4 files, 49 faces were identified and from these, 41 were identified by both raters, which equals 83.7%. On this subset, a Cohen's \u03ba inter-rater reliability was calculated of 0.62.

Based on this, the list of labels that should be exempted from hashing has been extended.

After further inspecting the false positive first names, the names 'Van', 'Door' and 'Can' were removed from the list with the 10, 000 most frequently used first names because they also represent words commonly used in free text, resulting in a lot of FPs.
