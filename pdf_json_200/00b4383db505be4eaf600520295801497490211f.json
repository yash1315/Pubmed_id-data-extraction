Arteriviruses infect equids, pigs, possums, nonhuman primates, and rodents. For example, equine arteritis virus causes mild-to-severe respiratory disease, typically in foals, or abortion in pregnant mares (2) . In pigs, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus types 1 and 2 cause a similar clinical syndrome of reproductive failure and respiratory disease (3, 4) . Wobbly possum disease virus causes an often fatal neurologic syndrome in possums (5) . Several other arteriviruses (Pebjah virus, simian hemorrhagic encephalitis virus, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus) cause highly lethal hemorrhagic fever in captive Asian macaques (6) . Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus was discovered by Riley et al. during their work on plasma enzyme levels in tumor-bearing mice (7) . Arteriviruses were detected in Chinese softshell turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis) that had hemorrhagic disease (8) and from healthy African giant shrews (Crocidura olivieri) by molecular assays (9) . Arteriviruses are documented to be transmitted through respiratory, venereal, and transplacental routes (10, 11) ; direct contact with infected possums has been the most efficient route of wobbly possum disease virus transmission.",

Blood, brain, liver, lung, and spleen from these 3 animals were also positive for HhAV-1 in this PCR. The tissues tested had relatively high viral loads, and blood and brain had the highest load (measured by using the cycle threshold:\u03b2-actin ratio) but not much higher than those for other tissues.",

Because no wild animals were identified as having neurologic signs, we infer that all cases were probably hospital acquired.

However, arteriviruses are known to cause persistent/ /1b, 2a, 2b, 3, 4 , 5, 6, and 7 that encode the polyproteins 1a/1ab, envelope protein, glycoproteins 2b-5, and membrane and nucleocapsid proteins, respectively.

The virus genome was aligned by using the MegAlign software of the DNASTAR Lasergene Core Suite (DNASTAR, Inc., https://www.dnastar.com), and phylogenetic analysis was performed by using MEGA 5.2 software (https://www.megasoftware.net). The rooted tree was constructed by using the neighbor-joining method and 1,000 bootstrap replications. Each virus on the tree is represented by its GenBank accession number and name. Designation of subfamilies was conducted as outlined in the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 2018 release (https://talk.ictvonline.org/ ictv-reports). Coronaviruses are included as an outgroup. Solid black circle and bold indicate strain detected in this study. Numbers along branches are bootstrap values.
