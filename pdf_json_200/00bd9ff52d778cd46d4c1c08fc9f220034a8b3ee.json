Methods Retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 47 maintenance hemodialysis patients who infected with COVID-19 and admitted to our hospital. According to their clinical outcome, these patients were divided into a survival group (n = 38) and a fatality group (n = 9). Information on the general condition and laboratory parameters of the patients were collected. Laboratory parameters were compared between different groups. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Results Statistically significant differences were observed in age, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) on admission (P < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the values of AUC of CRP, neutrophil count, LDH, white blood cell count, albumin, and procalcitonin were 0. 895, 0.813, 0.758, 0.757, 0.743, and 0.728, respectively. Conclusions Laboratory parameters including CRP, neutrophil count, LDH, white blood cell count, albumin, and procalcitonin were predictive on the prognosis of maintenance hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Among them, CRP was the strongest single predictive laboratory indicator.",

By Jan 7, 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was detected in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan [1, 2] . On February 11, 2020, the world health organization officially named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 . COVID-19 is a major infectious disease that seriously endangers the health of people. As of April 6, 2020, a total of 81,740 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed and 3331 patients have died of the disease in China [3] . COVID-19 is primarily manifested as an acute respiratory illness but it can affect multiple organs [4] . Previous studies have suggested that the elderly and those with underlying diseases were susceptible to COVID-19 infection, and more likely to become critical cases or decrease [5] . Wang's et al. study indicated that hemodialysis patients were at great risk of COVID-19 infection [6] . However, there is limited information regarding the prognosis of COVID-19 in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Therefore, we studied the association between laboratory parameters on the day of hospital admission and fatality of COVID-19 in maintenance hemodialysis patients. We hope that our findings could be helpful in finding key indicators of disease progression and unfavorable outcome, as well as providing guidance for subsequent clinical practice.",

The AUC of white blood cell count, neutrophil count, albumin, CRP, procalcitonin, and LDH ranged from 0.728 to 0.895. The AUC of CRP was the largest. The optimal working point was 45.2 mg/L, and the sensitivity and specificity to predict the prognosis of maintenance hemodialysis patients infected with COVID-19 were 88.9% and 68.4%, respectively. CRP is a useful inflammatory marker and indicator that plays an important role in host resistance to invasive pathogens and inflammation [20] . CRP is highly correlated with acute lung injury in 2019-nCoVinfected patients [21] . Besides, higher CRP has been linked to unfavorable aspects of COVID-19 diseases, such as cardiac injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome development, and fatality [22] [23] [24] . Therefore, the detection of CRP levels in COVID-19 with maintenance hemodialysis patients is of great value in assessing the severity of their condition.",

Among them, CRP was the strongest single predictive laboratory predictor. At present, a specific antiviral drug for COVID-19 is not available, and the fatality rate is still high. Moreover, the fatality rate of COVID-19 was even higher in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Therefore, clinicians should increase their awareness of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients. Early detection and effective intervention might be a benefit on reducing mortality of COVID-19 in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Besides, effective medical measures are needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in hemodialysis centers, such as body temperature measurement when entering the hemodialysis ward, wearing a medical mask during hemodialysis, COVID-19 patients isolation by admission to designated hemodialysis centers.",
