Additionally, health messaging can reemphasize that neglecting medical care might lead to increased morbidity and mortality among older adults from preexisting illnesses.",

            "text": "As of November 24, 2020, the US has reported approximately 12.3 million confirmed cases and 257,016 deaths due to COVID-19. 1 The global evidence says that a pandemic of this scale has certain potential indirect effects on essential and routine healthcare usage patterns. [2] [3] [4] There could be several plausible determinants driving the access to essential healthcare patterns, apart from the pandemic mitigation strategies such as lock down and social distancing, and severity of the pandemic itself. The existing social, demographic, and economic contexts, and underlying health conditions could be a few of such determinants. However, the current evidence is limited globally and specifically, in the USA on the indirect effects of COVID-19 on access to care for older adults during the pandemic. Due to preexisting conditions, older adults are usually at higher risk of COVID-19 related severe complications. 5 Additionally, negligence of routine medical care for chronic illnesses can lead to higher morbidity and mortality among older adults. There are several attempts to inform the potential impact of COVID-19 on emergency care, cardiovascular disease care, cancer care, and other essential outpatient care encompassing the general population. 4,6-10 However, to the best of our knowledge no study has explored the dimensions of access to care among the elderly population. Understanding the neglect of healthcare and potential reasons among older adults could be relevant for the policy makers to improve elderly health as the pandemic continues.",

The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) undertaken by the National Center for Health Statistics during COVID-19 shows 39.5 per cent of older adults had reduced access to care. 16 Overall, females and education of above bachelor's degree were more likely to report missing care. Additionally, about 31 per cent of older adults reported to have scheduled at least one telehealth appointment. The proportion of respondents reporting reduced access to care in these studies are higher than our study. The differences in the reduced access to care are possibly due to differing methodologies and recall periods. For instance, our study includes a nationally representative sample of older adults, whereas it was not the case with other studies. However, in line with these similar studies, our study finds female respondents and those with higher education levels tend to report reduced access to care during the pandemic. Among the elderly, research shows that being female is associated with reduced access even during non-pandemic times. 17, 18 We believe that respondents with higher education could be more aware of the risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection and hence delayed or avoided care altogether. 19 .

During the pandemic, health care providers and practices are striving to maintain stricter infection prevention and control guidelines with limited resources. 20, 21 This could have led to cancellations and rescheduling of visits to keep the patients and providers safe from potential spread of the infection. Respondents that need regular medical visits or prescription filling are more likely to have reduced access during the pandemic. Ironically, most of them suffer from preexisting conditions and research shows that they are at risk of developing serious complications if infected with COVID-19. 5 Based on our findings, we suggest urgent attention on improving access to care for older adults during the pandemic. For nonemergency conditions and routine care that can be delivered virtually, strengthening telehealth services will be helpful. Additionally, older adults' awareness on the availability and benefits of telehealth can be improved. Older adults would have to be reassured that the providers and healthcare facilities are taking adequate measures to ensure a safe environment and neglecting medical care might lead to increase morbidity and mortality from pre-existing illnesses. 22 Improving involvement of medical volunteers and voluntary organizations in supporting older adults can ensure timely care.",

Thirdly, the study did not collect specifically any information on virtual consultations. Due to the risk involved with in-person visits during the pandemic, many respondents might have opted for teleconsultations. Despite these limitations, our study contributes to the limited evidence on the patterns of access to care during the pandemic. To the .
