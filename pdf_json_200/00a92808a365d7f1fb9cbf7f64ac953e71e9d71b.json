While no drugs have yet been approved to treat this disease, small molecules effective against other viral infections are under clinical evaluation for therapeutic abatement of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Ongoing clinical trials include Kaletra (a combination of two protease inhibitors approved for HIV treatment), remdesivir (an investigational drug targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRP] of SARS-CoV-2), and hydroxychloroquine (an approved anti-malarial and immuno-modulatory drug). Since SARS-CoV-2 replication depends on three virally encoded proteins (RdRP, papain-like proteinase, and helicase), we screened 54 FDAapproved antiviral drugs and ~3300 investigational drugs for binding to these proteins using targeted and unbiased docking simulations and computational modeling. Elbasvir, a drug approved for treating hepatitis C, is predicted to bind stably and preferentially to all three proteins. At the therapeutic dosage, elbasvir has low toxicity (liver enzymes transiently elevated in 1% of subjects) and well-characterized drug-drug interactions.",

Drug targeting of helicase was shown to efficiently inhibit replication of other coronaviruses [8, 10] . Since helicase structure and function are conserved across the SARS family of viruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS [12] , we postulated that targeting the helicase protein should inhibit viral replication, independent of other inhibitory activities. Glide docking, followed by solventbased calculation of \u0394G for drug : helicase binding, predicts that elbasvir should be a singularly effective candidate drug to target the helicase nucleic-acid-binding pocket; \u0394G for elbasvir exceeds the next best drug, daclatasvir, by at least 15 kCal/mol, and zanamivir by 20 kCal/mol (Figure 3e ). Docking-pose modeling supports elbasvir binding to the predicted nucleic-acid binding pocket of the helicase protein (Figure 3f ).

We next modeled the elbasvir-helicase complex, which appeared to stabilize after ~40 ns (Figure 4c) , and retained crucial interactions such as Ser539 (Figure 4d) . We retrieved the structure of helicase bound to elbasvir at 100 ns, and attempted to dock it with single-stranded DNA. Elbasvir prevented helicase from binding to ssDNA, in contrast to stable binding in the absence of drug (Figure 5, c & d) . SsDNA was used in place of RNA, for consistency with structures previously reported for helicase : ssDNA [11, 12] . (a, b) , and preventing ssDNA from binding to viral helicase (c, d) .",

Its stability of binding to a wide variety of proteins from the same virus is rather surprising. Because elbasvir interacts with 5-10% of proteins taken at random, with binding energies comparable to those for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Figure 6 ), we infer that elbasvir is a highly reactive molecule -in common with many of the most effective therapeutic drugs -and is thus likely to have many off-target interactions [13] .

On the other hand, it is possible for effective drug combinations to derive their synergy from indirect effects. In treatment of HIV, for example, the combination of protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra TM ) derives most of its potency from lopinavir, with ritonavir contributing indirectly by delaying clearance of lopinavir [15] .

This may reflect the drug's dimensions (similar to a short stretch of RNA or ssDNA) fitting into nucleic-acid binding pockets, along with polar atoms appropriately oriented to form electrostatic interactions with target proteins. Binding-residue analysis indicates that elbasvir interacts chiefly with positively-charged residues including arginine and lysine, and the polar residue serine. A coronavirus must assemble its constituent proteins around the RNA core prior to exit from a host cell; this essentially obliges all viral proteins to have affinity for either RNA (typically via electrostatic binding of positively-charged amino acids to the strongly negative phosphates of the RNA backbone), or for another RNA-bound viral protein. We note in this regard that the 3 viral proteins having the strongest interactions with elbasvir are guanine-N7 methyltransferase, RdRP, and helicase -all of which have nucleic-acid binding affinity. A second plausible explanation would depend upon the evolution of this RNA virus by gene duplication [16] , resulting in viral protein structures that are all related and well conserved.",

The RMSD of elbasvir, shown as red tracings, initially increased and then stabilized or compacted after 20 ns (Figure 4a). However, the structure of RdRP itself remained unstable in the presence of elbasvir over 200 ns (blue RMSD tracings). The docking pose and the interacting-residue analyses at the 100-ns frame show metastable binding of elbasvir to RdRP in the predicted nucleic-acid-binding pocket(Figure 4b). To assess whether elbasvir binding would hinder RdRP interaction with RNA, we attempted to dock RNA with the elbasvir-RdRP binding complex observed at 100 ns.
