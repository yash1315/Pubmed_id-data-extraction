Antibody (Ab) tests that can detect IgG, IgM and IgA responses to spike or nucleoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been developed and allowed us to identify previous exposure or infection. In some populations these antibody tests have also become a surrogate marker of presumed immunity against reinfection.

Balancing their need for ongoing thrice weekly life-sustaining haemodialysis in a health care facility against their vulnerable status and advice to shield has been a daunting task. In addition, haemodialysis patients are considered to be immunodeficient and so the longer-term effect in those who have survived the virus is even less clear than in those without underlying health problems (2). More guidance is now available about measures to put in place to protect haemodialysis patients, but the hope for the future depends on the efficacy of vaccination (3).",

It is also worth considering that this population, despite being considered highly vulnerable, were unable to fully shield owing to regular visits to the dialysis units.

In line with this finding that immunosuppression leads to a slower rise in antibody levels; the slope of the Ab rise was lower in those on immunosuppression and indeed more patients on immunosuppressives had a fall in Ab levels during the study (p=0.02).

We also note that this is a combined IgG and IgM test, unable to discern which is the dominant Ab detected. It would have been useful to have been able to evaluate for levels of neutralising antibodies. Furthermore future works is required to measure T cell response which would help better understand the immune response seen. We currently do not know if these measured antibodies will confer ongoing protection in the face of re-exposure to SARS-CoV-19 virus and its new strains. Indeed we have recently published a concerning report of a patient in this cohort becoming critically unwell following a second episode of COVID-19, despite having positive antibodies with a last measured od of 95, who was subsequently found to have been exposed to the B.1.1.7, variant of SARS-CoV-2 (9). That this is the only such case of reinfection, however, in our large cohort is in itself reassuring, especially given high community prevalence in East London. This is obviously based on a relatively short period of follow-up and so it will be interesting to see if any protection persists and how we might usefully measure this to enable us to predict reinfection. Equally interesting will be to understand rates of re-infection with other mutations and any protective benefit conferred by these initial antibodies.",
