However, amplifying local community led sustainability outcomes remains an enduring challenge. We seek to fill a theoretical gap in the conceptualization of 'scaling up community-based fisheries management'. We draw on literature of agriculture innovations to provide a framework that takes into account process-driven and structural change occurring across multiple levels of governance, as well as different phases of scaling. We hypothesize that successful scaling requires engagement with all aspects of a governing regime, coalescing a range of actors, and therefore, is an enterprise that is larger than its parts. To demonstrate where the framework offers value, we illustrate the development of community-based fisheries management in Vanuatu according to the framework's main scaling dimensions.",

'Scaling up' often features prominently in programme design and theories of change (ToC), wherein successful ideas or practices need to be 'brought to scale'. In moving from the activities, outputs, and intermediate outcomes that typically populate the earlier stages of ToC to the final outcomes and impacts needed to effect on-ground change, attribution becomes muddier and accountabilities less clear.",

Critiques of the scaling literature suggest it remains too dependent on a theoretical framing provided by the diffusion of innovation literature (Rogers 2003; Johnson and Hagstr\u00f6m 2005) with its focus on technologies and the individual behaviours of innovators and adopters. This framing, it is thought, does not adequately account for governance contexts and cultural dimensions of how people live their lives and manage risk, and relies on the modality of spreading 'success' from case studies, proof of concept pilots, or nodes of learning . At worst, these framings situate innovation separately from the socio-political environment in which adoption and spreading take place.",

Physical and political remoteness of many coastal fishing communities in this part of the world, combined with often scarce state resources, means that national agencies are limited in their ability to centrally govern the dispersed, diverse and dynamic context of small-scale fisheries. In response to this limitation, CBFM has become a mainstream strategy in national programs for co-management of nearshore fisheries (Evans et al. 2011 ). This is evidenced in, for example, how CBFM forms a central component of high-level visions agreed globally for small-scale fisheries, as referenced in the 2015 Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Small-Scale Fisheries (FAO 2015) . Much of the work by government agencies, together with the support of non-governmental organizations (NGO) and academic communities, has, therefore, focused on finding effective ways to introduce, strengthen or support collaborative management arrangements by funding, researching and institutionalizing CBFM initiatives around the world (Wilson et al. 2003; d'Armengol et al. 2018) .",

Hence, rather than technical prescriptions, it might be more accurate to consider CBFM as a set of principles around collective action and sustainability that incorporate notions of social justice, stewardship, fairness, equity, leadership, and conflict resolution. Further, scaling these principles has to be framed more broadly than just communities, individual projects or individual national agencies.",

Analytically, it combines two approaches. First, the multi-level perspective (MLP) (Geels 2019) provides a lens through which to understand how innovations 'travel' across multi-scalar structures to ultimately be absorbed into systems and practice; moving from small experimental innovation to institutionalisation to broad societal absorption. Secondly, modal aspect theory is applied as a means to understand change pathways that result from scaling initiatives (Wigboldus et al. 2016) . It helps in revealing the diversity and coherence (or lack thereof) of everyday things and events, and ensures a broad recognition of how scaling can affect different aspects of people's lives or society as a whole. We focus particularly on the contributions of the multi-level perspective, given the already strong body of work in fisheries social science that explores the various impacts of governing initiatives on the complex lives and livelihoods of small-scale fishers (e.g. Jentoft and Chuenpagdee 2015) , which the modal aspect dimension of PROMIS addresses.",

Also, by recognizing our insufficient capacity for predicting the long-term impact of scaled innovations, responsible scaling calls for making the purpose orientation of scaling explicit-what, for who, and why-, and then adjusting expectations and strategies as scaling practices take shape.

Push approaches involve the deliberate introduction of something new to a system, like a technology or model of practice. A technology-focused approach promotes a technology that addresses a development problem as the subject-to-be-scaled. Such application is often justified by theories of change that assume 'if we introduce this, then that problem is solved'. In doing so, less attention is given to broader impacts beyond the defined problem-solution pairing. Goudzwaard et al. (2007) argue that technical solutions can result in new issues or even intensification issues as a consequence of narrow framing (see also 'solution paradox'). Model-focused approaches seek to overcome the complexity, variability and dynamism of contexts across large spaces (Wigboldus et al. 2016 ) by putting forward sets of defined processes and concepts as the subject for scaling. However, development experience has shown all too often how model approaches can produce blueprint solutions (Aswani et al. 2017) , reinforce uneven power relations (B\u00e9n\u00e9 et al. 2009 ), and create self-fulfilling outcomes (Steenbergen et al. 2017) .",

In the context of fisheries management, an example of a stalled innovation may include the disproportionate expansion of marine protected areas in relation to available management and enforcement capacity, resulting in 'paper parks' (De Santo 2013). Often, parts or lessons from stalled innovations may feed into new attempts at innovation, as, for example, when access rules around previously permanent fishery closure areas are adjusted spatially and/or temporally to address local food security and livelihood needs (Cohen and Steenbergen 2015) .",

As structural CBFM results emerge from push and pull innovations, they create collective uptake trajectories, illustrated by increased smaller clumping of blocks from left to right in Fig. 1 . With gradual but continued cumulative momentum in a relevant 'direction', a critical mass of uptake can contribute to regime shift, illustrated by dense clumping of blocks in a new configuration on the right in Fig. 2 . We illustrate here several examples of depicted block-and-arrow combinations. Light blue blocks drawn upwards by yellow arrows, for example, may symbolize communities that independently practice resource management as part of local custom. Influences of pull innovations (yellow arrows), like social networks across communities that offer means to exchange learning, share management responsibilities and strengthen governance around fisheries, may see the community networks expanding as new communities subscribe to it (Nong and Marchke 2006) . In doing so, customary practice finds compliment with broader strategies towards wider spread of management along coastlines. Dark blue blocks pushed upwards by red arrows, alternatively, may represent communities experiencing resource scarcity because of unsustainable fishing practices. The red arrows may be where the government has intervened to address this by, for example, establishing a collaborative arrangement to develop a local fisheries management plan. The deliberate interventions driving CBFM change encourage (i.e. push) a community towards fitting within a national coastal fisheries framework, thus simultaneously contributing to broader regime change. Green blocks representing national policy strategies that set out a development trajectory for coastal fisheries, or even global commitments (see sustainable development goals-UNDG 2015), may be framed as structural elements (exerting a push or inducing a pull) that drive local uptake and implementation of CBFM.",

This is not to say that a government's broader institutional boundaries and rule systems do not apply. On the contrary, they define both a particular allowable operating space with limits to how far 'pilot initiatives' can deviate from the norm, and the basic ethical considerations around testing new ideas in communities. In CBFM context various approaches and instruments gain traction once proven to contribute to local empowerment, knowledge and capacity building. In most cases this involves harnessing existing local fishing knowledge, practices and institutions, as shown in the Pacific region where customary tenure systems form the foundation from which various co-management arrangements have sprung (Foale et al. 2011) . In other cases, aspects of CBFM are introduced as something entirely new. In the Philippines, for example, community-based fishery monitoring activities has been introduced as a means to build knowledge of resource health and ecosystem behaviour, so as to inform adaptive management by a community and instil resource stewardship (Uychiaoco et al. 2005) .

For example, strategic long-term planning instruments for national agencies to strengthen coastal fisheries may be developed at any one time based on existing policy, and in doing so pave way for new innovations that are in line with CBFM to be adopted in the future. Schwarz et al. (2020) outline how almost a decade's worth of consultation in policy design processes in the Solomon Islands led to the eventual inclusion of CBFM plans in the Fisheries Act; thus formally recognizing customary marine tenure governance structures for the first time. They furthermore argue that its inclusion can empower local actors in fisheries management only if practitioners continually use it into the future. So where certain innovations can trigger more systemic change in the configuration and function of the regime, consistent adoption of these can lead then to more permanent transitions.",

Small island developing states (SIDS) with an atoll and archipelagic nature, for example, present a very different coastal fisheries landscape than that of a continental coastline.

We may see a bourgeoning academic literature that attempts to apply the broad CBFM thinking into a specific locale, buoyed by new sources of funding supporting research in development initiatives (Shilomboleni and De Plaen 2019) , and establishment of pilot sites. In the subsequent phase, CBFM would establish a foothold in the targeted geography. It stabilizes into a plausible large-scale design through activities such as experience sharing, standard setting and model building, which help to articulate best practices and how-to guidelines (Geels 2019) . Often these are led by government fisheries departments and/or (external) development agencies. The articulation of positive cultural visions is also important in this phase to help legitimize the CBFM principles and attract wider backing (Song and Chuenpagdee 2014) . Vocal opposition to CBFM may surface by social groups who experience negative side effects or feel insufficiently involved in decision making. At the same time, this is the phase where government officers, fishery extension workers, and fishing communities would start to embed or reinforce CBFM principles in the daily routines and practices (see Song et al. 2019) .",

These struggles may play out in the economic domain involving fish capture and market institutions. The struggles could also engender policy disruptions as well as cultural and cognitive conflicts about the framing of fisheries problems and solutions. There is no guarantee that CBFM as niche-innovations will inevitably win these struggles. The principles of responsible scaling have told us that there are likely winners and losers from the process of scaling. Thus, disruptions, if anything, should generate an opportunity to critically reflect upon the merits of an emergent CBFM approach.

(2014) conclude that the studied communities moved forwards and backwards in their progression towards CBFM institutionalization based on the fluctuating degree of political support.

The figure depicts (spontaneous and deliberated) processes and structures transitioning a regime towards a desired outcome based on a generic vision of 'implementing CBFM principles'; namely inter-and intra-connected sets of networks involving stakeholders doing and/or supporting CBFM that enables decentralized, polycentric governance of coastal fisheries over a defined large (national) space \u00d3 The Author(s) 2021 www.kva.se/en landscape contexts. Economic external pressures such as macro-economic recessions or trade sanctions may erode the financial resource base of an otherwise thriving innovation, while socio-political external pressures may be related to social movement protests, changing government coalitions or persistent negative media coverage to affect the legitimacy and political support for an existing niche or regime innovation (Geels 2019). Community-based fisheries is prone to such external influences and more. Highlevel policy discourses and global finances have historically produced a sizable effect on the way communitybased fisheries are imagined and practised, although not always in the best interest of the communities themselves (Steenbergen et al. 2017 ). More sudden external influences include natural disasters and severe weather events, which can devastate coastal areas and overwhelm communities' capacity to a quick recovery as learned from the typhoon impacts in the Philippines (Monteclaro et al. 2018) . Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has critically exposed the vulnerability of coastal fisheries to the sudden realities of blocked market access, border restrictions and economic loss, creating a damaging effect on fish value chains and the livelihoods of the communities (FAO 2020). Scaling of CBFM in such extraordinary times, may potentially be undermined by emergency governing responses of the government taking precedence over community bylaws and other CBFM proceedings. Conversely, the (over)burdens caused by COVID-19 on central governments around the world can highlight the need for local fisheries management capacity as a means to overcome the pandemic-induced community vulnerabilities (Steenbergen et al. 2020) . Such calls could add impetus among national and regional institutions towards furthering scaling progress.",

Drawing on PROMIS thinking (Wigboldus et al. 2016 ) around agriculture innovations we move theory beyond diffusion perspectives, and assumptions of linear, sequential implementation, by presenting a framework with a more integrative, cumulative perspective that incorporates reflexive insights on what scaling CBFM might involve. This perspective takes into account process-driven as well as structural change across multiple levels of governance, phases of innovation and stages of institutionalisation. In doing so, we highlight the fundamental interplay between targeted action at the niche (e.g. community) scale and cumulative conditioning of an environment to enable change or drive 'regime shifts'. In essence, we hypothesize that successful scaling requires engagement with all aspects of the governing regime, and therefore, is an enterprise that is larger than its parts.",

It provides a set of non-sequential areas of inquiry that direct us to (i) reflect on the potential positive and negative consequences of a scaling initiative (i.e. who benefits, who lags, are there ethical concerns, are there alternatives?); (ii) identify push and pull factors and their relative strengths and efficacy; (iii) understand regime-specific path-dependent 'stickiness' that may exert influence on scaling; (iv) examine the dynamics of scaling through combined process-driven and structural-driven changes; (v) assess, and potentially track, the relative 'position' of a scaling initiative in terms of degrees of structuration and phases of scaling; and (vi) consider impacts of external drivers on scaling trajectories. Such considered inquiry is imperative to allow subsequent translation into pragmatic tools and strategic guidance that can inform development of coherent (national) scaling programs. It can highlight potential entry points for design of effective monitoring mechanisms that drive mutually-responsive policy design and ground-level implementation. Box 1 briefly illustrates an application of the framework. Without offering an in-depth analysis, the CBFM case in Vanuatu preliminarily demonstrates the utility of the perspective offered through the four main dimensions of the framework (See ''Distinguishing structure from process-External drivers'' sections). Using the aforementioned ambition to develop 'national CBFM scaling programs' as an example of the way the framework can make sense of a regime shift over time, it highlights how the framework can further offer guidance and help to coordinate emerging CBFM scaling strategies and/or retrospectively identify gaps in scaling initiatives that are underway.",

            "text": "Although our thinking focuses in particular on scaling CBFM, the insights generated may be applicable across a broader set of initiatives that depend on local collective action for progress. Programs seeking spread in participatory natural resource management, rural livelihood enhancement, participatory conservation, remote health care provision and community development, all rely on synergetic collective organization at local levels. Ultimately, the framework holds potential as a tool with which to inform design and long-term planning for national development strategies. In that, the deliberate focus is on setting out principles and perspectives instead of proposing a type of governance model that would otherwise stipulate institutional structure and operational BOX 1: AN APPLICATION OF THE THEORY FOR SCALING CBFM Here we illustrate how the early evolution of a national coastal fisheries program can be usefully understood by considering a holistic scaling perspective as outlined by the different dimensions of the framework. In Vanuatu the evolution of CBFM can be traced to early initiatives in the 1990s. Raubani et al. (2017) write that at least seven externally-funded projects have had particular influence in shaping today's approach to CBFM in Vanuatu. The aim to develop and refine a CBFM approach for broad application in Vanuatu was first demonstrated with the implementation of the Japanese government-funded project, ''Grace of the Sea'' in 2006. Later, ambitions to scale CBFM were made more explicit through the Australian Government-funded ''Pathways'' project. Important developments at all three scales of structuration have been at play. At the niche scale, the series of bilateral projects worked in communities in partnership with the government. The trochus rehabilitation programme in the early 1990s provided early lessons to the government about the importance of community engagement. Raubani et al (2017, p.8 ) make note of Johannes (1998)'s observation that the government ''catalysed a striking upsurge in tradition-based marine resource management'' among communities during that period. Niche innovations consistently followed, both in the government (e.g. see Sami et al. 2020 ) and non-government sector (e.g. see Neihapi et al. 2019) , and over time were influential in the government's recognition of CBFM in the national Fisheries Act. Further evidence of this is the long-term strategic planning framework that sets out a national vision to 2030 for CBFM (Vanuatu Fisheries Department 2019). At the regime scale, western governance influence over time established a foundation for centralised fisheries management. However, the various niche-level interventions over the years have helped the government to strongly adopt CBFM (Raubani et al. 2017) . At the landscape scale, traditional structure and customary law provides the overarching cultural framework for regulating resource use and access, making the communities proforma owners of the resources.",

            "text": "CBFM outcomes often depend on internal community processes, not just the external support a community receives. According to Tavue et al. (2016) , during the ''Grace of the Sea'' project, there was notable willingness of the communities to enrol in CBFM, which may be seen as the promising sign of CBFM spreading throughout Vanuatu. Even then, however, excessive reliance of CBFM systems on external agencies has been an ongoing issue. Once external support dries up, sustaining CBFM activities largely depends on the ability of communities to negotiate different visions within the communities, resolve conflicts and engineer ways to continue to enforce community rules (L\u00e9opold et al. 2013) . The experiences of scaling CBFM in Vanuatu resemble the stage of stabilisation; through the continuing niche-level interventions in the form of external projects, combined with an increasingly strong commitment of the government, there is a plausible pathway to the adoption of a national program in Vanuatu. Influences of external drivers have been evident and will continue to impact pathways for change into the future. Various socio-political struggles have disrupted the trajectory, including pauses in foreign funding, introduction of new management paradigms, changes in government leadership or national emergency measures around COVID-19; as have biophysical disruptions in the form of natural disasters (tropical cyclone Pam and Harold in 2015 and 2020). All these elements play a part in constructing the trajectory of Vanuatu's CBFM regime shift across scales of structuration and phases of innovation.",
