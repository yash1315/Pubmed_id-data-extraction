Two patients initially treated with a high flow oxygen cannula deteriorated and later required invasive mechanical ventilation.Among the mechanically ventilated patients, 80% required ventilation in prone position during their stay in ICU according to our local protocol. The median highest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) recorded was 14 (IQR 12-16) cm H2O, and the median highest FiO2 recorded was 0.7 (IQR 0.6-0.9) during mechanical ventilation. Data on renal replacement therapy was available for 49 patients, ). Bacterial co-infections, defined as signs of infection requiring treatment during the ICU admission, were found in 26% of the patients and mostly concerned secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. In 8% of patients catheter related blood stream infections were observed. The median peak SOFA score for our cohort was 9.5 (IQR 6 -11), thereby representing a severely compromised population.During the study period VTE were increasingly recognized. Eighteen out of 50 patients developed VTEs (36%). In 13 patients pulmonary embolism was found, in 5 patients catheter related thrombi were observed, one patient developed a deep venous thrombosis of the forearm and one patient developed a spontaneous jugular vein thrombus (seetable 4). These complications occurred despite of the thrombosis prophylaxis that is generally administered to ICU patients.As of June 20, 2020, 37 of the 50 patients (74%) survived and were successfully discharged from the hospital, the remaining 26% of patients died. The median length of invasive mechanical ventilation in survivors was 15 days (IQR 12 -31), whereas the median length of invasive mechanical ventilation in non survivors was 10 days (IQR 6 -21). The length of stay in ICU was 19 days (IQR 11 -34) for survivors, compared to 10 days ( 6 -22) for non-survivors. The median follow up for patients who survived is 86 days (see table 4). Moreover, all patients had a follow up of \uf0b3 10 weeks. Compared with survivors, non-survivors are generally older, while no clear differences in their BMI and the number of comorbidities were observed (see figure). Moreover, no difference was found in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in survivors versus non-survivors (data not shown). DISCUSSION Critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to our ICU in the Netherlands with a follow up of 2.5 months show a survival rate of 74%, whereas the remaining 26% of patients died. All patients were admitted to the ICU due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The median length of mechanical ventilation was 15 days for survivors, compared to 10 days for non-survivors. Mechanically ventilated patients required high levels of support with a median highest recorded FiO 2 of 0.7 (IQR 0.6 -0.9) and median highest recorded PEEP of 14 cm H 2 O (IQR 12-16).

This study provides a characterization of the COVID-19 critically ill patients admitted to the ICU in a large singlecenter teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Moreover, during the study venous thromboembolism (VTE) was increasingly recognized and found in a third of critically ill COVID-19 patients. As VTE may have important clinical consequences, this merits attention.This single-center case series study was performed at the ICU of Jeroen Bosch hospital, 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. The Jeroen Bosch hospital is a 630 bed teaching hospital in the region of Noord-Brabant, the Netherlands. The hospital normally has 14 -16 ICU beds serving approximately 300.000 residents of the 's-Hertogenbosch and Bommelerwaard area. During the outbreak our ICU capacity was doubled with a total of 25 ICU beds designated for both COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients. This study is conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (version Oct 2008) and in accordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) and other guidelines, regulations and acts.
