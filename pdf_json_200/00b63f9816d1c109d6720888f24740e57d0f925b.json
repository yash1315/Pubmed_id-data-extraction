One of the most commonly adopted physiological parameters for assessing autonomic nervous system functioning in psycho-physiological research is based on the assessment of heart rate variability (HRV). The heart's pacemaker is controlled by both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system, which results in the natural variation of the interval between heartbeats. One important component of HRV is respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). This component is solely mediated by the parasympathetic subsystem through direct projections of the vagus nerve from the brain stem to the heart and is therefore also known as an index of cardiac vagal modulation. The term RSA is adopted since it defines the phenomenon of the relation between heart rate variability and the respiratory cycle (Shaffer et al., 2014) . This parameter is typically identified in the high-frequency component of HRV (HF-HRV), which ranges between 0.15 and 0.4 Hz, and by the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of the interbeat intervals (Shaffer & Ginsberg, 2017) .",

Moreover, lower RSA has been linked to conduct problems, trait hostility, anxiety disorders and depression (Beauchaine et al., 2019; Graziano & Derefinko, 2013; Patriquin et al., 2015) . Another important aspect of RSA is its positive association with appropriate social behavior as described by Porges' polyvagal theory (Porges, 2011) . The latter theory describes a parasympathetically driven social engagement system, which promotes the activation of interconnected craniofacial nerves and their associated motor behaviors. This way, a calm state -as induced by a heightened parasympathetic drive -is associated with prosocial behaviors including All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

            "text": "With respect to children and adolescents with ASD, the majority of studies have demonstrated lower levels of RSA in individuals with ASD during various activities (Benevides & Lane, 2015; Condy et al., 2019; Ellenbroek & Sengul, 2017; Patriquin et al., 2019) . This was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis, where statistically significant lower RSA-values were found in individuals with ASD during baseline measurements, social stress tasks, social debriefing tasks and cognitive tasks (Cheng et al., 2020) . Lower RSA levels in children and adolescents with ASD have been associated with higher levels of autism-specific symptoms such as social problems, internalizing problems, anxiety, emotional control issues, more severe visual and/or auditory sensory problems and repetitive and restrictive behaviors (Benevides & Lane, 2015; Condy et al., 2019; Ellenbroek & Sengul, 2017; Patriquin et al., 2019) . However, given methodological differences, multiple researchers have recommended further research on ANS functioning in individuals with ASD and how it deviates from TD peers (Cheng et al., 2020; Corbett et al., 2019; Lory et al., 2020; Lydon et al., 2016; Muscatello et al., 2021) . Therefore, a cross-sectional phase is included in this study in which a standardized stress-provoking assessment will be used in adolescents with and without ASD.",

Prior HRV-RSA biofeedback studies have shown that an increase of HRV was causally related to several positive effects on psychological parameters. These studies were performed in distinct clinical populations of all ages and variable medical and psychological conditions (Chudleigh et al., 2019; Darling et al., 2019; Gevirtz, 2013; Kennedy & Parker, 2019; Knox et al., 2011; Lehrer et al., 2020; Lehrer & Gevirtz, 2014; Thabrew et al., 2018) . In this protocol, individuals practice to breath at their resonant frequency, which can be found between 4.5 and 7 breaths per minute. Breathing at this frequency will maximize HRV oscillations due to the entrainment of two physiological mechanisms affecting HRV, namely the influence of the baroreflex and of the breathing pattern (Fiskum, 2019) . For more information concerning the hypothesized working mechanisms, see Lehrer and Gevirtz (2014) . Only one recent study provided evidence of feasibility of a similar intervention in a small sample (n = 7) of children and adolescents (10-15 years) with ASD (Goodman et al., 2018) . The current study will encompass a large-scale randomized-controlled trial, in which a representative sample of adolescents with ASD All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

The primary outcome measure is cardiac vagal modulation, which is hypothesized to be lower in adolescents with ASD. In addition, other physiological and behavioral parameters as well as cortisol measurements will be included as secondary outcome measures. These group comparisons will be highly informative to delineate indices of ANS functioning that are specifically implicated in ASD, and to evaluate whether aberrant physiology in ASD is associated with clinical and behavioral indices (e.g. predictive of increased social difficulties, repetitive behaviors, anxiety...) as reported previously.",

The intervention is hypothesized to lead to increments of cardiac vagal modulation as opposed to the control intervention. To determine whether the latter hypothesized increment can be maintained, a 5-week follow-up phase will be included. Further, it is hypothesized that an increase in cardiac vagal modulation relates to changes in behavior (e.g. improvement in social behavior) and/or physiological changes but that these might occur at a later stage, thus after the follow-up phase.

During home practice, the participants will be provided with a breathing pacer application, individually set to practice at the specified resonance breathing frequency (Awesome Labs LLC, 2020; Trex, 2015) . From the third supervised session onwards, participants will be instructed to breath in phase with their heart rate. The latter will be visualized on a computer screen and will replace the breathing pacer installed at their resonance frequency as described for the previous sessions. However, they will continue breathing at resonance frequency during home-practice. The sham-control group will follow the same steps as outlined above but they will practice at a normal breathing pace as determined during the baseline measurement at T0, thus faster than their resonance frequency. In addition, they will not receive any information regarding their own heart rate, as a default mode will be shown during the guided sessions. Each guided session will last approximately 30 minutes with several breaks in between whereas home practice sessions will last 20 minutes, which will be divided into four blocks of five minutes.

The longitudinal phase will determine the efficacy of a supervised RSA biofeedback intervention in adolescents with ASD. This intervention may provide multiple benefits for this population specifically due to its possibility to be practiced at home, as will be examined during the feasibility study of the non-supervised RSA based biofeedback intervention in this study. The latter can facilitate the integration and transfer into their daily routine. Given the high rate of co-occuring psychological symptoms and a hypothesized association between lower cardiac vagal modulation and these symptoms in individuals with ASD, an upregulation of cardiac vagal modulation may be valuable for this particular population. This can be accomplished by RSA based biofeedback intervention, as has been previously demonstrated in other populations including physical, behavioral, and cognitive conditions (Chudleigh et al., 2019; Darling et al., 2019; Gevirtz, 2013; Goodman et al., 2018; Kennedy & Parker, 2019; Knox et al., 2011; Lehrer et al., 2020; Lehrer & Gevirtz, 2014; Thabrew et al., 2018) .",
