However, as for any virus, SARS-CoV-2 is subject to constant neutral drift and selection pressure, with new M pro mutations arising over time. Identification and structural characterization of M pro variants is thus critical for robust inhibitor design. Here we report sequence analysis, structure predictions, and molecular modeling for seventynine M pro variants, constituting all clinically observed mutations in this protein as of April 29, 2020. Residue substitution is widely distributed, with some tendency toward larger and more hydrophobic residues. Modeling and protein structure network analysis suggest differences in cohesion and active site flexibility, revealing patterns in viral evolution that have relevance for drug discovery.",

            "text": "S evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 1 and rapidly spread worldwide, causing an ongoing pandemic. Although the sequence of its RNA genome is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have arisen independently from a bat coronavirus, 2 to which it shares 96% similarity. 3 The emerging SARS-CoV-2 subsequently gained a modified spike protein due to recombination in an intermediate host, possibly the pangolin, 4,5 followed by purifying selection for binding to the human ACE2 protein. 6 No therapeutic agents able to reduce SARS-CoV-2 mortality in clinical settings are yet known, although extensive efforts are underway to discover new drugs or repurpose existing ones to inhibit key viral proteins. Here we focus on the main protease (M pro ), which plays a critical role in viral replication. Like other betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that expresses all of its proteins as a single polypeptide chain, which is cleaved by M pro and the papain-like protease PL pro to yield the mature proteins. 7 Inhibiting this key enzyme would prevent viral replication, reducing viral load and thus symptom intensity. A similar approach was instrumental in making HIV a manageable disease. 8\u221210 However, the proteins in question differ markedly, rendering HIV protease inhibitors ineffective against SARS-CoV-2; indeed, a standard HIV protease inhibitor combination did not prove effective against COVID-19 in a recent clinical trial. 11 Specifically, HIV protease is an aspartic protease, whereas M pro is a 3CL cysteine protease. The 3CL cysteine proteases are characterized by a chymotrypsin-like fold and a cysteine-histidine catalytic dyad in the active site, implying both different structures and distinct chemical mechanisms. Although the general strategy of seeking protease inhibitors is hence viable for both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV, drug development for the former depends on characterizing this novel enzyme.",

In a host population, mutations accumulate with each viral passage, generating a mutational landscape rather than a single protein. The design of robust inhibitors that can protect against the multiple strains encountered in clinical settings requires the characterization of this sequence space and the populations of conformations it engenders. Furthermore, effective and rapid response to future emerging coronavirus diseases requires both in silico screening and experimental testing of antiviral agents and a validated library of relatively general inhibitors that can be used as a basis for the development of specialized therapeutics. Central to the success of that effort will be developing an understanding of structural and functional variation in SARS-CoV-2 proteins, particularly as mutations accumulate and new strains emerge.",

For example, mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a topic of intense current interest, as its D614G variant appears to confer enhanced infectivity, 24 has spread rapidly through the global population, 25 and correlates with a higher mortality rate. 26 M pro appears to be relatively tolerant of mutations near the active site, 27 underscoring the importance of mapping the mutational landscape of active variants so that inhibitors whose binding depends on highly specific interactions with mutationprone residues can be eliminated early in the screening process. Here we characterize all 79 known variants of M pro as of 29 April, 2020, and analyze trends in amino acid substitutions and the resulting structural changes for both monomers and dimers, using molecular modeling and moiety-level protein structure network analysis. Our analysis shows a trend toward substitution for larger and more hydrophobic residues versus the WT protein. Analysis of active site networks (ASNs) from M pro variants suggests differences in active site flexibility and cohesion that may serve to guide the design of robust, mutation-resistant inhibitors. Intervariant differences are also observed among the dimer interfaces, which is another potential inhibitor target.",

Initial conditions for the WT trajectories used here are based on the PDB structure 6Y2E, 36 representing a mature (i.e., cleaved pro-sequence) protein. For monomer trajectories, the A chain of 6Y2E was employed. Initial variant monomer and dimer structures were, respectively, predicted using MODELLER 9.23, 37 using the 6Y2E structure as a template; three rounds of annealing and MD refinement were performed using the \"slow\" optimization level for each (final objective function values are provided in Table S7 ). Initial structures were then processed to correct protonation states to reflect their predicted cellular environment (with protonation states predicted using PROPKA 3.1 38 ). Each corrected model structure was then minimized and equilibrated in explicit solvent; simulations were performed using NAMD 39 with the CHARMM36 force field 40 in TIP3P water 41 at 310 K under periodic boundary conditions (with a 10 \u00c5 margin water box). Solvated protein models were energy-minimized for 10 000 iterations before being simulated for 0.5 ns, followed by a water box size adjustment, after which a 10 ns trajectory was simulated with conformations being sampled every 20 ps; an NpT ensemble was used, with temperature controlled via Langevin dynamics with a damping coefficient of 1/ps and Nose\u2212Hoover Langevin piston pressure control set to 1 atm. 42 49 Vertices were defined using the method used in ref 50, where each node represents a chemical moiety, with edges being defined by interatomic contacts. Specifically, two nodes i and j are considered adjacent if i contains atom g and j contains atom h such that the g and h distance is less than 1.1 times the sum of their respective van der Waals radii (using values from ref 51). The node definitions are illustrated in Figure S1A , and a small-moiety PSN of this type for WT M pro is shown in Figure S1B . Active site networks (ASNs) were constructed from each PSN as described in ref 52 . Briefly, all vertices belonging to the catalytic Cys and His residues were identified, along with all vertices adjacent to these vertices within the PSN. The ASN was then defined as the subgraph of the corresponding PSN induced by this combined vertex set ( Figure S1C ). In the case of dimer models, one ASN was constructed for each chain.",

All calculations were performed using the sna library 46 for R. For dimer PSNs, interfacial moieties were identified by selecting all vertices adjacent to at least one vertex in the opposing chain, and average core numbers were computed for these interfacial vertices to assess cohesion in the dimerization interface; raw counts of edges spanning the two chains (interfacial tie volumes) were also calculated. For each vertex associated with a moiety in the active site, three measures identified as associated with active site constraint by ref 52 were computed: the degree, or number of ties to other vertices; the triangle degree, or number of triangles (3-cliques) to which the vertex belongs; and core number, or number of the highest degree kcore 54 to which the vertex belongs. Physically, these, respectively, indicate the total number of contacts associated with the chemical group (potentially impeding its motion), the number of truss-like, triangular structures in which the group is embedded (again, restricting mobility), and the extent of local cohesion around the chemical group, which is found to distinguish \"tighter\" and \"looser\" packing regimes. 55 To summarize the impact of each measure over the active site as a whole, values were averaged across active site vertices. As an additional constraint measure, the number of paths between each pair of active site vertices through neighboring (i.e., nonactive site) vertices was computed, and the log of the minimum of this value over the set of active site vertex pairs was employed as a measure of site cohesion. Intuitively, high values of site cohesion indicate that all active site chemical groups are connected by a large number of indirect contacts, while low values suggest that at least one pair of active site moieties has few local pathways holding them together. These four indices (mean active site degree, mean active site triangle degree, mean active site core number, and site cohesion) were used to produce an omnibus index of site constraint via principal component analysis (PCA) of the standardized network measures over all modeled conformations, as described in ref 52 . This first principal component (the constraint score) accounted for approximately 71% of the variance in all four measures in the case of monomer ASNs, and the ratio of its associated eigenvalue to the next largest was approximately 4.7 (confirming the dominance of the principal eigenvector). This process was repeated for the dimer ASNs, resulting in a constraint score vector accounting for approximately 69% of the total index variance, with an eigenvalue ratio of approximately 4.3.",

The whitened residuals from the time series model were then used to construct 5000 parametric bootstrap replicate series, which were then refit to obtain bootstrap replicate means.

Hyperparameter tuning was performed via grid search, with the performance assessed by reconstruction of a held-out sample of 100 randomly selected ASNs, following training on a separate sample of 1000 ASNs. Reconstruction was performed using the preimage method from ref 59 with a local sample of 10 neighbors; the optimal hyperparameter obtained was \u03f5 = 0.0739. Following hyperparameter tuning, principal component scores were calculated for use in subsequent analysis. Analyses were performed using R 49 with portions implemented using Rcpp. 60 \u25a0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Mutations in M pro Are Geographically Distributed. From the GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) 28 EpiCoV database (through April 29, 2020), 78 unique nonsynonymous mutations to M pro were found in addition to the WT sequence, Biochemistry pubs.acs.org/biochemistry Article including 73 single point variants and 5 double variants. For genome sequences containing these M pro variants, full genome alignments were performed using MUSCLE, 32 and neighborjoining trees were generated using MEGA X. 33 Overall, the variation in SARS-CoV-2 sequences observed so far is relatively low, with mutation hotspots not evenly distributed throughout the genome, but localized to specific sequence regions. 61 Because M pro is critical for viral replication, mutations that have a large deleterious effect on virus replication are unlikely to be observed in clinical isolates; all M pro variants investigated here are therefore assumed to be enzymatically competent. In general, codon usage and amino acid frequency in viruses of eukaryotes are essentially identical to those of their eukaryotic hosts, reflecting the viruses' use of the host translation machinery. 62 The known mutations in M pro are summarized in Figure 1 . The tree was generated based on overall genome similarity; however, only sequences containing at least one nonsynonymous mutation in M pro were included in the analysis, along with the WT human sequence and two nonhuman reference sequences. The accession numbers and geographical sources are listed in Table S1 . The solid arcs around the outside of the diagram indicate M pro mutations; color coding corresponds to the geographical source. Several mutations appear to have arisen more than once in the virus's evolutionary history so far. Notably, K90R variants appear in multiple distantly related subtrees; five of these unique evolutionary events can be verified in Nextstrain's SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree. 63 Further, L89F, P108S, and N274D arise at least twice in both trees. Optimal tree generated using 512 full mutant genomes and three reference genomes: human wild-type (WT), 64 bat, 3 and pangolin. 65 Only topology is shown; branch lengths are not to scale (average branch length = 1.432161 \u00d7 10 \u22124 base substitutions per site). Each continuous arc corresponds to a variant label; these represent only adjacent branches with the same mutation in M pro and do not necessarily indicate shared ancestry. Branches and arcs from human clinical samples are color coded by location, which includes the following subregions: Africa, light blue (Democratic Republic of the Congo); Asia, green (Beijing, Fujian, Malaysia, Shanghai, Vietnam, and Wuhan); Australia, gold; Central Eurasia, pink (Georgia, Jordan, Russia, and Turkey); Europe, red (Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Wales); North America, purple (Costa Rica and United States of America); South America, yellow (Argentina and Brazil). Subtrees that contained identical subregions and mutations have been condensed into a single branch; all subtrees and their constituent accessions can be found in Table S1 . D These phylogenetic comparisons appear to support a multiple event hypothesis but are subject to errors resulting from the sparsity of testing. The repeated occurrence of the same mutation in seemingly unrelated subtrees may be due to missing data that would show their evolutionary connectedness. The average branch length of Figure 1 , which shows only topology, is 1.432161 \u00d7 10 \u22124 base substitutions per site (including those from the bat 3 and pangolin 65 ); 32.2% of the 1028 branches have, to ten significant figures, 0 base substitutions per site. For a genome of roughly 30 000 base pairs, this amounts to an average of only 4 substitutions per branch. All of these unique mutants therefore effectively belong to the same strain, making them difficult to place in an evolutionary context. For more diverged mutants, unfortunately placed ambiguous nucleotides 30 could push them from one subtree to another. With the exception of five double variants, the sequences in Figure 1 arise from single point mutations. Whether and how M pro mutations have affected viral fitness is not yet known, but at least three mutants have remained in the population long enough to accumulate another mutation: L220F to A191V/L220F, G15S to G15S/D48E and G15S/V35L, and K90R to V77A/K90R. It is worth noting, that although a single variant A191V exists, the A191V/L220F double variant likely stemmed from an L220F ancestor due to its shared lineage with L220F single variants. A fifth double variant, A193T/R279C, was found but did not stem from any single mutation in our data set; its origins remain unclear.",

Testing rates, social behavior, and time of first infection in each region are all factors that contribute to the spread of the disease and the availability of sequencing data. For instance, a large number of K90R mutants were collected in Iceland, where the number of tests per 1000 people is nearly twice as many as the next leading country's and more than seven times as many as the United States' (Iceland, 141.75; USA, 18.21, as of April 29, 2020). 66 Consequently, further investigation is needed to determine whether M pro mutations affect viral fitness on a global scale. As such, without greater divergence and more sequences, it is difficult to tell if the presence of an M pro mutation in unrelated subtrees is evidence of multiple evolutionary events, or an artifact of sparse testing. Despite these caveats, it is clear that these 78 variants are functional enough to infect people within their local populations. In the structural analyses that follow, we focus on the differences in protein properties of the clinically observed M pro variants relative to WT.",

It is likely that the strains that had spread to underrepresented regions prior to our data collection simply did not have M pro mutations. Different regions tend to be dominated by different mutants, a feature that might be explained by the timing at which these mutations arose or arrived. For instance, 83 of the 100 M pro mutants from Iceland were K90R, and most stemmed from a single shared ancestor (see Supporting Information). Further, it is likely that heterogeneity in sequencing rates have resulted in a lessthan-complete data set. As of April 29th, the only North American, South American, and African M pro mutants reported in the GISAID database that passed our filtering parameters were from Costa Rica and the USA, Argentina and Brazil, and the DRC respectively.

To reveal the global pattern of substitutions, we visualize mutations in M pro independent of sequence position or location in the three-dimensional structure, by a network where the nodes, or vertices, are amino acid types and the edges (represented by arrows pointing in the direction of substitution) are directional indicators of how often one amino acid was observed to substitute for another ( Figure 2 ). The weights of the edges indicate the frequency of the mutation across known M pro variants, while node color reflects residue hydrophobicity on the scale of Kyte and Doolittle. 67 The most obvious trend observed in the pattern of mutation so far is the preferential substitution of larger, more hydrophobic amino acids in place of smaller, less hydrophobic ones. The pattern is consistent with increased incidence of amino acid types that April 29, 2020 . Arrows indicate the direction of substitution: an arrow from i to j indicates at least one clinically observed substitution of residue type i to residue type j; heavier lines indicate larger numbers of observed substitutions. Color indicates hydrophobicity, using the scale of Kyte and Doolittle. 67 In general, substitution has been toward larger and more hydrophobic residues. Biochemistry pubs.acs.org/biochemistry Article are more likely to be present in folded domains rather than those found more often in less-structured linker regions. 68 In particular, it is notable that alanine has very few incoming ties and a large number of outgoing ties, mostly to valine, which has a larger and more hydrophobic side chain. Alanine is at the same time one of the most common amino acids and one of those with the most variable prevalence in the human genome. 69 Similarly, observed ties to isoleucine are mostly incoming from smaller residues; leucine likewise has more incoming than outgoing ties, with the bulk of its outgoing ties going to phenylalanine, which is also large and hydrophobic. However, aromatic residues per se do not appear to be selected. For example, tyrosine has mostly outgoing ties. Also notable are the selection away from the secondary structure breakers proline and glycine, both of which have only outgoing ties, and the propensity for lysine to be replaced by arginine even though both side chains are positively charged. Arginine is both larger and capable of making more and stronger hydrogen bonds, as well as cation-\u03c0 interactions not available to lysine, leading to its known overrepresentation in interdomain and intermonomer interfaces. 70\u221273 The mean differences in side chain properties for observed M pro mutations are summarized in Table 1 . As observed in the network representation (Figure 2 ), on average, the mutated residues are larger and more hydrophobic than the ones they replace. Although substituted residues are on average larger and more massive, we do not see strong evidence favoring bulky residues over more compact ones, independent of mass: residue bulk (measured as volume/mass) for substituted residues did not differ significantly from WT (mean difference = 0.02 \u00c5 3 /Da, t = 1.87, p = 0.0650). The variant sequences are not significantly different from WT in charge or aromatic content.",

            "text": "M pro Mutations Occur Throughout the Protein. In order to provide context for the discussion of conformational changes and the locations of mutation sites, a ribbon diagram of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro monomer is shown in Figure 3A . The three domains, the active site residues, and other structural features are labeled. The dimer is shown in Figure 3B ; the dashed box shows the approximate location of the interchain salt bridge shown in Figure 3C . In SARS-CoV-1 M pro , this salt bridge between Arg4 of Chain A and Glu290 of Chain B is an important component of the dimer interface, 74 and substitution of either or both of these residues with alanine resulted in shifting the equilibrium from dimer to monomer, although dimerization was not abolished completely. 14 Panels D and E show two different views of the dimer interface, with key residues labeled. In addition to important interfacial residues, we also highlight key residues near the oxyanion hole, a structural feature found in many serine and cysteine proteases that stabilizes negatively charged, tetrahedral transition states. 75 In SARS-CoV-2 M pro , several interactions at or near the dimer interface play a role in keeping the oxyanion hole in the active conformation. An intrachain hydrogen bond between the side chain NH 2 of Arg298 and the backbone carbonyl of Met6 appears to help hold the N-terminus (also called the Nfinger) in place to make the appropriate contacts with the other chain. 76 In the S1 specificity pocket, a ring-stacking interaction between the side chains of His163 and Phe140 is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds comprising residues from both monomers. Hydrogen bonding interactions between Glu166 and Ser139 of Chain A with the N-terminus of Chain B (Ser1) are also important for stabilizing the dimer interface, along with interactions between the Ser10 residues of both chains. Mutating the adjacent Gly11 to Ala completely abolishes dimerization due to a dramatic conformational change to the N-finger that causes disruption of the interface. 21 Although the mutational studies discussed here were performed using SARS-CoV-1 M pro , many of the key residues are also found in SARS-CoV-2 M pro , and we hypothesize that they play similar roles. Figure 4A shows the M pro dimer with mutation sites indicated by spheres. The mutations observed so far are relatively evenly distributed throughout the protein. Notably, mutations are tolerated close to the active site residues, near the oxyanion hole, and at the termini, both of which are involved in modulating the dimer conformation. 17 Two different views of the dimer interface are shown in Figure  4B , with interfacial residues shown as space-filling models and with mutated residues highlighted in light blue (Chain A) or dark blue (Chain B). Despite the importance of the dimer interface, several mutations are observed in this region: M6L, A7V, A116V, S121L, C300S, S301L, and G302C. Particularly notable are M6L and A7V, which are part of the N-finger that participates in interactions with the C-terminal domain of the second monomer. In both cases, the hydrophobic character of the residue is preserved, with a slight increase in the size of the residue. With the exception of A116V, the other mutations represent qualitative changes in side chain properties. These changes in chemical properties are apparently well tolerated, as all of these mutations were found in clinical isolates.",

Intuitively, high values of v(\u03b1 i ) indicate relatively large between-variant variation in \u03b1 i relative to angular variation seen within the trajectories themselves. For v(\u03d5 i ) and v(\u03c8 i ), such values correspond to systematic changes in local conformation associated with M pro mutations. By turns, low values of v(\u03d5 i ) and v(\u03c8 i ) indicate residues whose local structure does not vary meaningfully across variants. It should be noted that such regions can be either flexible or rigid. Figure 5 shows the mean local variation indices for \u03d5,\u03c8 by the residue for the 79 M pro variants, indicated by color on the structure of M pro WT. (Separate values for \u03d5 and \u03c8 are shown in Figure S7 .) It is immediately noteworthy that, with the minor exception of two small loop regions around N277 and F223 (respectively), Domain III shows little systematic variation across variants. The \u03b2-sheet-rich structure around the active site is also relatively well-conserved. By contrast, we see relatively high levels of between-variant difference in the interdomain region involving the termini (residues G2-A7 and S301\u2212F305) and the double loop \"active site gateway\" region involving (respectively) L50-Y54 and D187-A191. The former is potentially significant in influencing large-scale flexibility (possibly relevant to dimerization), whereas the latter is of obvious relevance to substrate processing and specificity. This motivates a more detailed examination of variation in the active site, to which we return below.",

To assess this, we employ protein structure networks (PSNs), which are well-suited for assessing the looseness or cohesiveness of contacts among chemical groups. Figure S1 ) The assessment of global cohesion was performed by computing the mean degree k-core number for all moieties in each structure; to allow comparison of global cohesion within domains, we also compute mean core numbers within each of the three domains. The mean core number can be considered an index of structural cohesion, with higher values indicating greater numbers of redundant contacts among chemical groups. 55 To account for within-trajectory autocorrelation in comparing mean core numbers, autocorrelation-corrected parametric bootstrap confidence intervals and standard errors were employed. Figure 6 shows global and domain-specific cohesion levels (i.e., mean core numbers) for all variant monomers, sorted in descending order of mean cohesion. Means and standard errors for each variant can be found in Table S3 . As suggested from the torsion angle analysis, cohesion differs significantly among variants, both globally and within domains. On average, the majority of variants are estimated to be less cohesively structured than WT, with the exception of Domain III (in which WT does not differ significantly from the mean). It is possible that these differences indicate selection for more globally flexible structures (again, with the exception of Domain III). Whether or not this is the case, however, it appears clear that less cohesive structures are not strongly selected against. Such flexibility may affect dimerization kinetics, which is relevant to protease function and the development of robust dimerization inhibitors.",

            "text": "While cohesion and flexibility within M pro monomers may provide clues to how mutations may impact dimerization, examination of the interfacial region within M pro dimers suggests indications of the impact of mutations on the behavior and stability of the dimers themselves. Figure 7A shows mean cohesion scores (i.e., mean degree k-core numbers) for interfacial moieties in dimer trajectories for all M pro variants, together with autocorrelation-corrected 95% bootstrap confidence intervals; values are also provided in Table S4 . (We here define a moiety to be interfacial if it is adjacent to at least Figure 7C ). This is assessed on a frame-by-frame basis, allowing us to account for changes in contact patterns within trajectories.) Although there is some variation in interfacial cohesion, relatively few trajectories differ significantly from the mean cohesion level, and very few are two standard errors away from wild-type (12 being more cohesive and 1 being less cohesive). This is consistent with the hypothesis that interfacial cohesion is strongly conserved in M pro , suggesting that a looser or more dynamic dimer core may impede function. (The fact that, of those variants differing significantly from WT, all but one show greater cohesion is also consistent with this determination, albeit not determinative.) For a different look at interaction across the interfacial region, we also consider the total number of contacts between the A and B chains over time (the tie volume across the dimer interface, e.g., the interfacial ties in Figure 7D ). Figure 7B shows mean dimer interface tie volumes and associated confidence intervals for the M pro variants, with variants sorted in the order of the mean core number to facilitate comparison (panel A). Whereas the mean core number provides a measurement of overall structural cohesion at the interface (including both interactions within and between chains), the tie volume directly measures the number of cross-chain contacts and is thus a potential proxy for interaction strength. As with cohesion, tie volume is fairly well-conserved, and few trajectories show significant deviation from wild-type (with seven trajectories having higher tie volume than WT, and two lower). Interestingly, interfacial tie volume is not strongly related to interfacial cohesion, indicating that the tightness or looseness of the structure around the interface is not simply a function of the raw number of interfacial contacts. Both, however, suggest a relatively high level of conservation in interfacial structure in the M pro dimer across variants observed to date. While the first version of this work, which addressed moiety-level networks of M pro monomers 77 was under review, a preprint 78 was released, showing similar results using residuelevel network analysis on MD trajectories of M pro dimers, and subsequently published. 79 Although different methodology is used, the conclusions are in broad agreement, with significant flexibility observed in the N-finger region that is important for dimerization, as well as the loops near the active site. The authors also describe key low-frequency motions of the dimer that may be impacted by mutation and identify a pocket near the dimer interface that could serve as a potential target for allosteric inhibitors, underscoring the importance of mutational analysis as a part of effective inhibitor design. Moiety-level network analysis of M pro dimers was then added to this paper in response to reviewers' comments, again finding substantial agreement with the residue-level results. 78 Active Site Networks Suggest Potential Activity Differences across M pro Variants. The observation of structural variation in loop regions associated with the binding pocket motivates closer examination of variation in the M pro active site. To this end, subgraphs of the full protein structure networks comprising moieties belonging to the active site residues and their neighbors were constructed to produce active site networks (ASNs) 52 for all conformations. A ASNs, are shown in Figure 9 . Values for both monomers and dimers are also provided in Tables S5 and S6 . Examination of the mean constraint scores for each variant trajectory suggests potential activity differences across M pro variants. Figure 8A shows mean constraint scores for each variant monomer, with autocorrelation-corrected parametric bootstrap confidence intervals. Of the 79 trajectories examined, 22 (28%) were significantly below the grand mean (dotted vertical line) and 28 (35%) were significantly above it; similarly, when directly compared to WT, 12 variants were observed to be significantly less constrained, while 17 were significantly more constrained (i.e., bootstrap t-scores less than \u22122 or greater than 2, respectively). A total of 43 out of 79 M pro sequences (55%) showed nominally higher levels of mean constraint than WT (discounting significance), suggesting a lack of uniform selection pressure for active sites that are more or less constrained than WT (the fraction greater does not differ significantly from random deviation, p = 0.16, exact binomial test). Thus, although we do not see evidence here of systematic selection for net changes in active site constraint in the monomeric state, we do see evidence that variants differ from each other and from WT in their average active site properties. Turning to the dimer trajectories, Figure 9A shows mean constraint scores for A and B chain active sites, with autocorrelation-corrected parametric bootstrap confidence intervals for each variant. Consistent with the hypothesis that dimerization can result in asymmetric modification of active site conformations, 20 we frequently observe large differences in the active site constraint between chains within the same variant; indeed, the root-mean-square difference in mean constraints within the variant is significantly larger than would be expected from the variation across sites alone (p = 0.048, permutation test), being approximately 1.65 times the standard deviation in mean constraint across variants. That said, such differentiation is not always present, with many trajectories (including WT) showing similar levels of constraint for both active sites, and it may not be necessary for function. (We observe that symmetric active site conformations were obtained in the WT dimer structure of Zhang et al., 36 for instance.) Unlike the monomeric case, we see a greater trend here toward reduction in dimer active constraint scores versus WT, with 76% of sequences showing constraint levels lower than WT (p < 0.0001, exact binomial test). It is possible that this reflects a higher level of selection for looser active sites in the dimeric state per se. These differences should be considered when designing inhibitors that are tolerant of mutational change in M pro over time. In particular, it is clear that the population of extant M pro variants already possesses some phenotypic diversity in active site flexibility, potentially facilitating its ability to evolve around some types of inhibitors. The ability of M pro dimers to sustain active sites with different levels of flexibility may also complicate inhibitor design and suggests the importance of inhibitors that are robust to variation in active site constraint.",

            "text": "Overall Variation in M pro Active Site Conformations Is Related to Cys/His Contact. Given the diversity of active site conformations across monomeric/dimeric states, variants, and chains, it is useful to seek specific features that can be used to characterize those conformations. To examine this, we employ a kernel principal component analysis (kPCA) of a stratified sample of ASNs from the set of monomer and dimer trajectories, taking 25 evenly spaced frames from each trajectory (including both A and B ASNs in the dimeric case) for a total of 5925 conformations from the entire data Biochemistry pubs.acs.org/biochemistry Article set. The feature space for our kernel is the set of all labeled subgraphs on the set of potential ASNs, allowing us to detect specific patterns of contacts among moieties that characterize subpopulations of conformations. As shown in Figure 10 , the combined set of active site conformations falls into two fairly distinct clusters obliquely aligned with the first two principal components. These respective clusters correspond to a single feature, specifically the presence or absence of at least one contact between the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues; the cluster aligned with the first principal component consists of \"open\" conformations lacking such a contact, while the cluster aligned with the second principal component consists of \"closed\" conformations in which the contact is present. Both clusters have an ellipsoidal form, with distance along the ellipsoids away from the origin corresponding to the average number of contacts per chemical group (mean degree). The cluster ellipsoids are also slightly oblique to one another, an orientation that arises from their joint respective correlation with the total number of moieties interacting with the active site residues (ASN size); this is shown in Figure 10 via the gradient of the size distribution, indicated as contour lines. These three properties (Cys/His contact, mean degree, ASN size) thus provide a parsimonious description of the most important axes of variation in active site structure and may be useful as targets for experimental investigation (e.g., via NMR). Interestingly, we observe very little association between conformation and monomer/dimer status (R 2 < 0.6% on the first PC, and no significant difference on the second-highest R 2 in the first 10 dimensions of 1.4%), indicating that the full range of active site conformations is observed in both monomer and dimer structures and at similar frequencies.",

            "text": "For clinically relevant variants of M pro , the observed variation so far is toward larger and more hydrophobic amino acids, leading to reduced structural cohesion on average in the variants relative to wild-type. Although mutations occur throughout the protein, the structural effects of those mutations appear to be far more localized, impacting primarily the protein's interdomain interfaces and several key loop regions near the substrate-binding pocket. These mutations appear to result in systematic variations in both global flexibility and in the extent to which the catalytic residues of the active site are constrained (a factor previously found to be related to substrate specificity in related systems). Our results suggest that M pro may be currently subject to selection for enhanced global flexibility and that currently circulating M pro variants represent a reservoir of phenotypic diversity in active site structure and dynamics that could facilitate an evolutionary response to certain classes of protease inhibitors. These findings are relevant to dimerization kinetics, substrate capture, and the development of resistance to inhibitors, as well as our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 more generally. On a more methodological note, these results underscore the potential of comparative in silico studies to rapidly probe structural and functional consequences of genotypic variation in emerging diseases. Advances in both GPU-enabled hardware and molecular dynamics have made high-volume simulation studies feasible over short time horizons, giving us a powerful tool for selection of experimental targets. At the same time, comparative analysis of large volumes of trajectory data created by such simulation studies remains a challenge. Here, we have used both network analytic and machine learning techniques to identify potentially important sources of variation across trajectories. Although network analytic ideas have been used to study protein structures at least since 1993, 80 systematic use of combined network analytic and MD trajectories for comparative analysis of protein variants is more recent. 81\u221284 It is hoped that applications such as this one will inspire further development of this promising approach.

Per ref 52, we compute for each ASN a constraint score, a general measure of active site flexibility that is associated with substrate specificity. The constraint score is the first principal component of a set of several network metrics (see Materials and Methods), with higher values indicating a greater tendency for the catalytic residues to be constrained by cohesive contacts with other residues, and lower values indicating fewer such constraints. Examples of ASNs corresponding to the maximum, minimum, and mean observed constraint values over all observed M pro monomer conformations are shown inFigure 8. For the dimer structures, we repeat this process for the active site in each chain, yielding two constraint values per variant; these scores, along with corresponding maximum, mean, and minimum constraint",
