Viral RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained both from inpatients and outpatients. COVID-19 infection was confirmed according to the Ct values for N1 and N2 genes ascertained by Real-Time RT-PCR assay as described by the CDC. We calculated the prevalence of nasopharyngeal swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the mean and median of the Cts and the percentage of samples equal or below the Ct value of 25 in the 3 periods considered. The average value of Ct increased, going from 24.80 in the first epidemic period to 26.64 in the second period to 28.50 in the third period (p <0.001). The percentage of samples with Ct lower than or equal to 25 also decreased sharply from 54.7% to 20.0%. These findings need to be integrated with epidemiological and clinical data.

In real time PCR the cycle threshold (Ct) values are inversely related to viral RNA copy numbers (8) . ECDC underlines that SARS-CoV-2 detection for diagnosis of patients with COVID-19-like symptoms is essential for patient care, triage and isolation in healthcare facilities. SARS-CoV-2 detection can also be used for screening close contacts for asymptomatic infection and disease as part of contact tracing or outbreak investigations. Testing is also used to screen for infection in crucial target groups like healthcare and social workers as part of local surveillance programmes (8) .",

However, in the first phase of the epidemic, the samples came largely from hospitalized patients with medium-severe clinical symptoms, while in the third part most of the samples came from non-hospitalized subjects involved in local screening activities. Many samples, especially in the second period under study, were so-called \"healing samples\", that is, performed in subjects declared clinically healed and then performed at least 14 days after the onset of symptoms. Beyond the clinical significance, it is difficult to establish the real epidemiological significance of such low viral loads, considering the different framework of population tested. These hypotheses need to be verified with specific studies aimed at integrating epidemiological and clinical date.",
