The decision to pursue teleconsultation should be discussed directly with the primary medical team, to ensure that expectations are aligned. Video telemedicine consultations may be reimbursed at the same rate as similarly complex in-person consultations.",

Fewer regulatory hurdles, increased reimbursement and innovation in telemedicine will also facilitate sustained adoption of telemedicine. Innovation is already underway to develop new tools that can enrich the telemedicine encounter. Many telemedicine programs in gastroenterology and IBD already include an electronic survey of symptoms and telemonitoring systems. 15, 16 The physical exam can already be augmented using tools such as smart watches and devices that can record heart rate, record respiratory rate, generate an ECG tracing or serve as an in-home stethoscope. 17 The use of mobile applications to monitor patient-reported outcomes has been studied extensively, but has not achieved widespread adoption. Point-of-care and home testing (e.g. kits for faecal calprotectin or finger stick for blood evaluation) may provide valuable information to providers regarding IBD disease activity, especially if access to a laboratory or capacity to perform endoscopic staging procedures is limited. A study of three calprotectin home tests with companion enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] tests showed 76-87% agreement for faecal calprotectin \u2264 500 \u03bcg/g, 18 suggesting this measure could be an accessible management strategy for objective assessment of disease activity.",

Best practices for a successful telemedicine visit Telemedicine setup Choose a telemedicine platform that: \u2022 can provide a secure, private connection \u2022 is compliant with local government regulations of telemedicine \u2022 can be easily implemented by both patients and provider Pre-visit preparation Prior to a telemedicine visit: \u2022 Develop a workflow to identify patients who are appropriate for telemedicine visit [vs those who need in-person evaluation] \u2022 Provide instructions to patient on how to access telemedicine platform, including tips for troubleshooting \u2022 Clinic staff may opt to perform a 'dress rehearsal' with patient to ensure patient can easily access telemedicine platform \u2022 Utilize electronic tools to collect history and data from patient [online questionnaire, eHealth, IBDoc, myIBDcoach]. Ideally, this can auto-populate in the electronic medical record \u2022 Clinic staff [e.g. medical assistants, nurses or others] can 'pre-' chart and input clinical information including IBD scores \u2022 Find a space that is quiet, private and without distractions to conduct visit \u2022 Determine if telemedicine visit must be performed by provider in a clinic space [rather than from home] in order to optimize reimbursement and meet regulatory requirements During the visit \u2022 Medical Assistant may 'room' the patient and review insurance, demographics, preferred pharmacy and perform medication reconciliation \u2022 Obtain verbal consent to perform video visit \u2022 Obtain history and limited physical examination \u2022 Complete visit, communicating follow-up plan Addressing technology challenges \u2022 Can mostly be avoided by pre-visit trial with medical staff and/or providing a tips sheet for troubleshooting ahead of time \u2022 Trial of alternative platform [e.g. FaceTime, WhatsApp] \u2022 If all else fails, convert to telephone visit After the visit \u2022 Provide electronic copy of after-visit summary. \u2022 Route prescriptions and laboratory orders electronically. Drive-through pharmacy and delivery options should be encouraged \u2022 Instruct staff to contact patient to schedule follow-up care Documentation \u2022 Use similar note template to in-person documentation \u2022 Use a physical exam template appropriate for video visit \u2022 Document that patient provided consent to conduct telemedicine visit \u2022 Document the modality used for the visit [e.g. real-time audio and video connection]",
