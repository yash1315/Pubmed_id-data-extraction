Based on the cultural values theory, our first hypothesis was that in countries that are predominantly individualistic, the number of deaths will be high, whereas in countries with predominantly collectivist values, the number of deaths will be low. Our second hypothesis was that countries with high power distance and hierarchy will have fewer deaths compared to countries with low power distance and egalitarianism. The hypotheses were tested by referring to two different value studies (Hofstede's study of 76 countries and Schwartz's study of 75 countries) while also controlling for GDP per capita, Gini index, population density, median age per country, and BMI per country. Of the five control variables GDP and BMI significantly predicted coronavirus deaths. Taking into account GDP, Gini index, population density, median age, and BMI, hierarchical regression analyses confirmed the first hypothesis on individualism and the second hypothesis on egalitarianism. Therefore, in the case of this current pandemic, group-oriented and collectivist values and low egalitarianism values lead to specific health-related behaviors that ultimately keep more people alive.",

The United States, for example, has a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $21M (World Bank), but it accounts for most deaths that have occurred due to COVID-19. As of July 18, 2020, there had been 137,674 deaths in the United States alone and in March 2021, there were over 500,000 deaths in the United States. On the other hand, many of the poorest countries, such as Fiji (with a GDP of $5,535), Jamaica (with a GDP of $16,458), and Namibia (with a GDP of $12,366), have handled the situation relatively well. Researchers have debated, and it has been found that social factors, such as inequality and poverty, lead to more increased exposure to the virus and increased risk of death (Elgar et al., 2020; Marmot and Allen, 2020; Patel et al., 2020) . Thus, we assessed the relationship between a country's level of development-using the GDP per capita, the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI, which combines the three dimensions of health, education, and income in one score and adjusts for inequalities within countries), the Gini index (as a measure of income inequality), and healthcare-related expenses per capita-and the number of COVID-19 related deaths.",

            "text": "We argue that additional factors that exacerbate exposure to COVID-19 and increase the risk of death are certain sociogeographic features of a country, such as population density. One would argue that the more a country is densely populated, the higher the risks for exposure, spread, and death-a finding supported by Zhang and Schwartz (2020) when studied within the United States. However, some countries have been able to control the virus relatively well-despite population density, while some countries have not. For example, countries that are densely populated have sometimes managed to quickly enforce effective public health practices; one such example is Taiwan, which, due to its experiences with the SARS epidemic, has implemented the following policies: using facial masks, screening incoming travelers, using 4-h test kits, quarantining symptomatic patients, and employing rapid contact tracing and widespread testing (Chen, 2020; Lin et al., 2020; Wang C. J. et al., 2020) . Thailand, another densely populated country, also managed to quickly enforce measures, such as having temperature checks in workplaces, imposing curfews along with the police guarding checkpoints, installing spraying stalls to disinfect people, and providing protective shields at street food stalls and for each table in schools (Beech, 2020) . Thus, we wanted to assess whether population density relates to the spread of Low infection rates in Thailand were also due to the partnership among various governmental and private sectors (Tantrakarnapa et al., 2020) . Similarly, Jordan became one of the first countries to implement a severe lockdown (Alqutob et al., 2020) ; it closed airports, borders, and stores and was able to prioritize the needs of vulnerable groups such as the poor, children, elderly, and refugees. This was done by immediately distributing food to the poor, providing government assistance to 50% of their citizens, and banning companies from laying off their workers while still allowing companies to reduce employee wages and reduce public sector salaries (Arraf, 2020) . As seen in these countries, as well as in a study of 84 countries, death rates have been impacted by societal governance factors such as confidence in state institutions, civic engagement, and implementation of certain policies and regulations of behaviors that are followed by their citizens (Elgar et al., 2020) . Thus, in studying health behaviors surrounding COVID-19 and death risk, we are including government effectiveness, one of the six worldwide governance indicators, which specifically highlights the perceptions of the quality of public services independent from political pressures, the formulation of policies and their implementation, and the quality of infrastructures in serving the people (Kaufmann et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Equally important in health behaviors implemented by the government to decrease exposure to COVID-19 and to decrease the risk for mortality are individuals' protective health factors. As protective health factors, young age and low body mass index have been discussed (e.g., Tartof et al., 2020; Wang X. Q. et al., 2020) . Conversely, obesity and older age are identified as factors that make people vulnerable to mortality among COVID-19 inpatients (Pettit et al., 2020) . In addition, health behaviors, such as consistently wearing masks and face shields, staying 6 ft apart from people, staying away from crowds and places with poor ventilation, regular hand washing, etc. (Center for Disease Control Prevention, 2020), are related to fewer COVID-19 deaths (Conyon et al., 2020) . These health behaviors, which mitigate the pandemic, are supported by extant social and behavioral research, including cultural values specified in individual and collective interests and the social and cultural context (Bavel et al., 2020) . We thus argue that health behaviors are directly related to certain cultural values. Values are the guiding principles for people's thoughts and behaviors; they are desirable goals that motivate action (Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck, 1961; Schwartz, 1994; Kemmelmeier et al., 2002; G\u00fcss, 2011) . Following cultural values theory, we argue that the cultural values of Individualism-Collectivism and Power Distance have a direct impact on people's behaviors that protect them from the virus exposure and, ultimately, on the number of COVID-19 related deaths.",

Alternatively, collectivism in society exists when people are interconnected since birth, relationships are solid, and people watch out for each other (Hofstede, 2001; Hofstede et al., 2010) . The focus is on how people regard collective identity, the meaning derived from these connections, and involvement in common goals and shared activities (Schwartz, 2020) .

When, however, as the authors state, national wealth is controlled for, the correlation weakens and becomes \u22120.36. Some researchers identify the dimensions as separate and others as one. For this study, we use the dimensions separately. In addition to using the cultural values of Hofstede, we also included the cultural values of Schwartz. Schwartz states (1994, p. 117 ) that when compared to Hofstede's dimensions his ideal value types are different based on different \"theoretical reasoning, different methods, a different set of nations, different types of respondents, data from a later historical period, a more comprehensive set of values, and value items screened to be reasonably equivalent in meaning across cultures.\" Whereas, Hofstede assumes four (he later added a fifth dimension Long-Term versus Short-Term Orientation and a sixth dimension Indulgence vs. Restraint) value dimensions: Individualism-Collectivism, Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Masculinity-Femininity, Schwartz (2020) identified three bipolar value dimensions: autonomy (intellectual and affective) vs. embeddedness, egalitarianism vs. hierarchy, and harmony versus mastery.",

In order to acknowledge different countries' varying levels of development and differences in demographics, we controlled for the two economic variables: GDP and Gini index; for one socio-geographic variable: population density; and for two individual health factors: median age and BMI. Findings of the regression analyses show that of the five control variables, only GDP and BMI were significant. The higher the BMI, the higher the number of COVID-19 related deaths. This finding is supported by Fakhry AbdelMassih et al. (2020) and Pettit et al. (2020) , who found that obesity is a potent predictor of death from COVID-19: as the BMI increases, the risk for mortality also increases.",

High collectivism will increase the likelihood to comply with Covid-19 protective guidelines, while individuals with high individualistic and person-focused values might be less likely to comply [see also Wolf et al. (2020) ]. Our findings validate what Elgar et al. (2020) propose that some dimensions of social capital, such as caring for the community, lead to fewer deaths. Other research found that higher prosocial tendencies were related to an acceptance of making sacrifices such as accepting a temporary economic lockdown (Howard, 2021) . While reiterating that cultural values influence how communities react to and behave in this pandemic [see also Seale et al. (2020) ], our findings indicate that people who care primarily for themselves and have less regard for the consequences of their actions on others behave in ways that are related to personal gain, convenience, and enjoyment, which may increase exposure and risk to the virus. When this happens, the spread of COVID-19 increases, which then ultimately leads to an increase in the number of deaths. However, when a society unites and cares for all other people in their community in solidarity, people behave in ways that consider the consequences for other people's health and safety. As a result, the spread of COVID-19 is mitigated, which then leads to lower death rates.",

Although some of the data have been conducted decades ago, the cultural value dimensions have been replicated and validated many times (e.g., Van Nimwegen, 2002; Cheng et al., 2013) . Moreover, even though research has shown an overall tendency for countries to be moving slightly toward individualism, cultural differences have remained quite stable over time (Manfredo et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2017) . This is because the manner in which values are formed and sustained makes them fairly resistant to change. Further, although the study is correlational and no causation can be assumed, findings show significant relationships between cultural values worldwide and COVID-19 deaths.",

It is not primarily economic variables that can prevent COVID-19 deaths. It is not solely individual health-related factors, the primary of which is the BMI, that predict COVID-19 related deaths. It is noteworthy that, according to our findings, especially when pertinent variables are controlled for, it is the bottom-up cultural values in a country that are related to COVID-19 deaths. These values, which have remained quite stable over time (Manfredo et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2017) , are significantly associated with mortality from COVID-19. In countries where individualism is predominant, there is a challenge to change what is believed and regarded as important. With COVID-19 as a precursor to change, countries would make significant strides against the increasing number of deaths when public health policies stress the common good, collective health, and valuing the community and each other. Change happens on the individual level-valuing individuals as separate and disconnected from other individuals cannot sustain the world in this nor any pandemic.",
