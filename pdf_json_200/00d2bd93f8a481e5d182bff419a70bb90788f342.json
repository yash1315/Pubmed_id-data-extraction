The benefit of machine learning, as an essential aspect of artificial intelligence, on past epidemics offers a new line to tackle the novel Coronavirus outbreak. Accurate short-term forecasting of COVID-19 spread plays an essential role in improving the management of the overcrowding problem in hospitals and enables appropriate optimization of the available resources (i.e., materials and staff). This paper presents a comparative study of machine learning methods for COVID-19 transmission forecasting. We investigated the performances of deep learning methods, including the hybrid convolutional neural networks-Long short-term memory (LSTM-CNN), the hybrid gated recurrent unit-convolutional neural networks (GAN-GRU), GAN, CNN, LSTM, and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), as well as baseline machine learning methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR). The employment of hybrid models (i.e., LSTM-CNN and GAN-GRU) is expected to eventually improve the forecasting accuracy of COVID-19 future trends. The performance of the investigated deep learning and machine learning models was tested using confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases time-series data from seven impacted countries: Brazil, France, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US. The results reveal that hybrid deep learning models can efficiently forecast COVID-19 cases. Also, results confirmed the superior performance of deep learning models compared to the two considered baseline machine learning models. Furthermore, results showed that LSTM-CNN achieved improved performances with an averaged mean absolute percentage error of 3.718%, among others.",

World Health Organization (WHO) and numerous national authorities worldwide battle facing these pandemics to date. The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic that has initially been identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 remains a significant problem facing our modern world [1] . As reported by the World Health Organization, 213 countries and territories worldwide are contaminated with the COVID-19. The COVID-19 virus can spread in diverse ways, such as direct body contact, infected money, air from contaminated persons when coughing, or sneezing [2] . The incubation period of COVID-19 of a minimum of fourteen days plays a crucial in its propagation [3, 4] . Thus, the accurate forecast of recovered and contaminated COVID-19 cases is indispensable in managing the outbreak and preparing efficient procedures to slow down the spread of COVID-19.",

With recent advancements in computer and software technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent in healthcare systems to detect disease and perform clinical diagnosis. Moreover, this recent outbreak shows the necessity and possibility of using AI for outbreaks prediction. In other words, AI tools possess powerful feature extraction capabilities, which enables extracting relevant features from rapidly evolving data to support public health experts in decision-making. One of the key features of AI is its ability to rapidly extract pertinent information from multi-sources including health reports, social media, news, and media. In past outbreaks (e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003), limited data were available [5] . With easy access to different data sources, AI tools have become even more necessary in healthcare systems.",

Recently, COVID-19 has received remarkable consideration from the research community, the epidemiological experts, and local authorities [19, 20, 15] . Various studies have been reported in the literature for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19 diseases using X-ray imagery [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] . In [1] , COVID-19 detection is addressed as a classification problem involving three classes: pneumonia, COVID-19 affected cases, and normal cases based on X-ray imagery. To this end, a support vector machine (SVM) is applied to the extracted features by CNN models (MobileNetV2 and SqueezeNet). However, the detection is performed in a supervised way, which demands data labeling. In [22] , Goel et al. considered an optimized CNN (called OptCoNet) to automatically diagnosing of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images. The Grey Wolf Optimizer has been used to optimize the hyperparameters of the CNN model during the training phase. They applied the OptCoNet approach for discriminating normal from pneumonia patients and showed satisfying results. In [25] , Turkoglu Muammer proposed an expert-designed system for COVID-19 diagnosis based on X-ray images. Specifically, a pre-trained CNN-based AlexNet model has been used as a features extractor.",

This paper is aimed at presenting a comparative study of machine learning-driven methods for COVID-19 transmission forecasting. Notably, this study investigates the efficiency of deep learning methods to forecast recovered and confirmed COVID-19 time-series and assess their performance compared to the traditional forecasting methods. Essentially, six deep learning models, including the hybrid convolutional neural networks-Long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), the hybrid gated recurrent unit-convolutional neural networks (GAN-GRU), GAN, CNN, LSTM, and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), are introduced and compared to the base-line methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR), for forecasting confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases time-series data. Here, the employment of hybrid models (i.e., LSTM-CNN and GAN-GRU) is expected to eventually improve the forecasting accuracy of COVID-19 future trends. For instance, in CNN-LSTM, this combination aims to integrate the capabilities of the LSTM in modeling time dependencies and the good ability of CNN in extracting features from complex data. As far as we know, this is the first time these two hybrid models were investigated to enhance the forecasting of COVID-19 time-series data. Confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases time-series data from seven impacted countries, namely Brazil, France, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US, are used to compare and verify the performance of the considered deep learning methods. The six deep learning methods and two commonly used machine learning methods, namely LR and SVR, were applied to daily recovered and confirmed COVID-19 time-series datasets from January 22nd, 2020, to September 6th, 2020.",

Results confirmed the superior performance of deep learning models compared to the two considered shallow machine learning models, namely logistic regression and support vector regression. The results highlight that the hybrid LSTM-CNN model reaches the best forecasting performance, followed by the hybrid GRU-GAN model. Also, it has been shown that the considered hybrid models outperform the other considered non-hybrid models. Furthermore, this study has demonstrated that time-series modeling and forecasting are not restricted to only recurrent models like LSTM and GRU. Still, it can be extended to other generative composite models, such as GAN-DNN and GAN-GRU, or standalone models like RBM that showed a good forecasting ability with low computation cost and less number of parameters compared to the other considered models. Moreover, we showed that deep learning models provided satisfying forecasting results even with a relatively small amount of data. Thus, these methods can be extended to deal with different communicable diseases, such as SARS [52] , EBOLA [53] , HIV [54, 55] , and COVID-19, and non-communicable diseases including Cancer [56] , Diabetic [57] , and Heart disease [58] outbreak.

During the fine-tuning step, a predictor layer with a single output to perform the The performance of the considered deep learning-driven methods is compared with traditional forecasting methods, SVR and LR, to validate their efficiency. The SVR and LR are deployed on a rolling window where the previous five days records are taken as covariates to forecast counts of one day ahead. Indeed, SVR showed good performance in various time series forecasting problems [65, 66, 67] . This is mainly because of its capacity to feel with the overfitting problem using kernel tricks and without the need for the specification of data distribution [68] . LR, which are usually incorporated into machine learning and deep learning models, can be viewed as a shallow neural network composed of one layer with a logistic function also called sigmoid formulated as f (x) = 1 a+e \u2212x [69] . LR has also been used in forecasting time-series data [69] . Here, a window sliding procedure is applied to reshape time-series data used by the SVR and LR models. Of course, SVR and LR are trained to learn to map a given sequence to its next value in the training phase, and then they are applied to unseen data to predict future observation (forecasted data).",

The obtained forecasting results are tabulated in Tables 6. Results in Table 6 show that the quality of the forecast from the six trained models is promising. Table 6 indicates that deep learning models exhibited improved forecasting performance compared to the shallow methods (LR and SVR). We observe that the MAPE values of SVR and LR (data recorded from India and Brazil) are larger than 100%, which means that the forecasting errors are much greater than the actual values [70, 71] . It is interesting to see better outcomes from the three hybrid models (GAN-DNN, GAN (Table 6 ). In comparison, the non-hybrid models can achieve acceptable outcomes for all time-series. Again, the LSTM-CNN model keeps the best score in terms of the evaluation metrics and dominates the other models. Table 7 presents the averaged statistical metric per model to evaluate the overall performance of the considered models. The forecasting results support that the hybrid models outperform the considered standalone models. The LSTM-CNN is dominating the other models by achieving an MAPE of 3.718%.

Because deep learning models are efficient to model long temporal dependencies embed in time-series data (e.g., RNNs, LSTM-CNN, and GAN-GRU). The RNN-based models can capture short and long temporal dependencies in time-series data using memory and gate mechanisms. Also, RNN considers the past data to generate its output. This structure makes it appropriate to model time dependency than the traditional feed-forward that generates the output using only the current input.",

The accurate COVID-19 spread forecasting models do not only support the management of the available resources in hospitals but also help slow down the progression of such diseases. In this study, short term forecasting of COVID-19 cases has been carried out through hybrid deep learning models to provide suitable forecasting accuracy. Towards this purpose, the LSTM-CNN model has been introduced for COVID-19 time series forecasting. Overall, we compared three hybrid models (i.e., LSTM-CNN, GAN-DNN, and GAN-GRU) and three standalone deep learning models (i.e., CNN, LSTM, and RBM). In other words, we examined the capability of advanced structures of deep learning methods in forecasting COVID-19",

Indeed CNN learns to extract features based on a series of nonlinear transformations via several Convolution and Pooling operations that usually end with a fully connected layer. CNN can extract features first and perform the internal features mapping based on one-dimensional (1-D) sequences data represented by COVID-19 cases recorded.

On the other hand, traditional LSTM and CNN are trained in a supervised way.Precisely, training a CNN model consists of extracting features from the input depending on the data structure like images, a 2D signal, or for sensory data of 1D. In contrast, LSTM belongs to gated recurrent neural networks designed to deal with time-series and data sequences to extract and discover temporal dependencies like text processing, where the objective is to predict the next word of a given sentence (a series of words).The training procedure of the deep hybrid LSTM-CNN is supervised. The two models LSTM, and CNN, are simultaneously trained (Figure 3). The time-series data (input) is processed first by LSTM, resulting in temporal features space that feeds CNN. The forecasting is done through the last layer of CNN with a single output. The role of CNN is to learn the mapping of the temporal features to the next value in the original input (recovered or confirmed COVID-19 cases).This study aims to compare deep learning methods to forecast COVID-19 time-series data. Towards this end, the present work uses two hybrid deep learning models (i.e., LSTM-CNN and GAN-GRU), four standalone deep learning models (i.e., GAN, CNN, LSTM, and RBM), and two baseline machine learning methods (i.e., LR, and SVR), and results are compared based on COVID-19 data from six well-impacted countries.",

Also, the standalone models (LSTM, CNN, and RBM) can capture most of the variance in data with low forecasting error.

This could be due to the fact the double feature extraction performed by the deep hybrid model during the learning process. In other words, in the hybrid LSTM-CNN model, LSTM can capture time dependencies and the 1D feature extractor CNN predict the next value of a sequence of values. On the other hand, GANs (GAN-DNN and GAN-GRU) as a deep composite architecture (designed initially for image generation) demonstrate the potential of the generative models to fit COVID-19 time-series data and their ability to approximate the data distribution of time series data accurately. Also, we noticed that the RBM model obtain acceptable forecasting performance even with a straightforward architecture based on only two layers (i.e., visible and hidden layers), making it suitable for online forecasting. This experimental study reveals that building a composite deep learning model can considerably improve the forecasting accuracy, where each element of the hybrid architecture plays an essential role in modeling temporal dependencies embed in the time-series data of the recorded COVID-19 cases.
