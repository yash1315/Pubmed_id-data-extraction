            "text": "S evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 (1) , that has rapidly expanded to become a worldwide pandemic. The spectrum of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease ranges from mild, nonspecific influenza-like symptoms, to a second stage characterized by progressive hypoxia and pulmonary infiltrates. The most severe stage of the illness, characterized by the production of multiple cytokines, results in endorgan dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and increased mortality. Although no specific therapy has been identified and validated in clinical trials, tocilizumab has been suggested as a possible immunomodulatory agent to offset what has been referred to as the cytokine storm (2) . Numerous studies have reviewed the utility of tocilizumab with varying results (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) .",

This was a multicenter study evaluating patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) for a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted between March 13, 2020, and April 16, 2020. Patients were evaluated retrospectively and concurrently through chart review and direct interactions with the prescribing MIDC physician. This study was independently approved by Western Institutional Review Board (2660026-44769273). Tocilizumab was prescribed at the discretion of the ID physician with consideration of local hospital treatment protocols. Variables for evaluation included the patient's age, sex, race, date of admission, time from admission to MV, usage of steroids, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in combination, and remdesivir therapy. Comorbidities evaluated included age greater than 60 years old, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchospastic illness, chronic cardiac or renal disease, immunodeficiency, or neoplastic disease. The tocilizumab dose was recorded by the timing of administration in relation to the date of hospital admission and MV. Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within 1 day of intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered greater than 1 day after intubation. Markers of inflammation including ferritin, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were recorded at the time of dosing for the treatment group and time of intubation for the control group. Patient dispositions were recorded as discharged from the hospital or expired.",

In contrast, several trials have shown a positive clinical impact when tocilizumab is given prior to intubation or when oxygenation requirements markedly increase. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial, yet to be released, claims that tocilizumab reduces the need for MV in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (10). Mortality rates for patients requiring MV are significant and have varied from 24.5% to 79% (11, 12) . Overall, 51.7% of the patients in our study expired. A statistically significant mortality differential was characterized by the timing of the tocilizumab administration. Patients who received an early tocilizumab dose showed a statistically significant decrease in mortality as compared to patients who were untreated (16.22% vs 56.76%; p < 0.001), after adjusting for demographic characteristics and steroid use. In addition, patients in the control group were placed on MV later than patients in the early and late treatment groups, suggesting a slower or less fulminant disease. As has been delineated in other studies, non-White and elderly patients were more likely to succumb to their illness. Although we did not identify any secondary infections in our patient population, several authors have reported an increase with tocilizumab therapy (13) .",
