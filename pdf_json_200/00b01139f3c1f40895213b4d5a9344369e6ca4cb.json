Currently, one of the most pressing needs worldwide is to vaccinate against COVID-19 as many people as possible, within the shortest time lapse. This is certainly no easy matter, as important considerations and controversies are called into question. At present, vaccine prioritization is based on data regarding age-related COVID-19 mortality and privileges older people and healthcare workers who have faced the pandemic in frontline. However, while the selection of these categories may be obvious and supported by either solid scientific validity or political wisdom, the prioritization of individuals categorized as \"vulnerable\" constitutes a gray area of uncertainty. In this regard, prioritization of patients without a spleen, either surgical or functional, represents a thought-provoking example of a Janus-faced issue.",

A recent study of ours [4] , looking at both in vivo and autoptic signs of defective spleen function, showed that IgM memory B-cell depletion was very common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (87.3%), and this was associated with a higher mortality rate (28.6%). Apart from three patients who had been previously splenectomized, all other patients did not have pre-existing diseases that could explain such spleen defect and, furthermore, IgM memory B-cell depletion occurred irrespective of older age, sex, and number of comorbidities. In the two autoptic cases, a selective SARS-CoV-2-induced damage of the B-cell compartment of the spleen was noticed, and this, along with the normal counts of circulating pitted red cells (i.e., erythrocytes with membrane abnormalities visible under phaseinterference microscopy and named pits, whose increase is a marker of spleen hypofunction), points to COVID-19 as a unique disease model of dissociation between the red pulp filtering function and the marginal zone immunological competence of the spleen [1] . Notably, as this immunological defect persists beyond the resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection [4] , this could make ineffective the prophylaxis against encapsulated bacteria through traditional polysaccharide vaccines.",

Moreover, given the lack of evidence, it is still unknown which is the best vaccination (mRNA-based or viral vector-based) strategy for this patients' category. On the other hand, the durable persistence of a defective spleen function beyond COVID-19 convalescence in patients who were not originally asplenic, poses the problem to define the vaccination timing, given that memory B cells are essential for mounting a proper immune response after COVID-19 vaccination.",

Further studies are needed to solve the numerous clinical controversies arisen by this Janus-faced disease model, to clarify whether asplenic patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased morbidity of COVID-19 asplenic patients. In this regard, the lack of secretory IgA in the mucosal surfaces of splenectomized patients might provide a putative pathophysiological explanation [5] . Coordinated and harmonized vaccination strategies are needed to defeat the pandemic, and we urge COVID-19 vaccine prioritization be based on solid scientific evidence which must include special populations and minorities.",
