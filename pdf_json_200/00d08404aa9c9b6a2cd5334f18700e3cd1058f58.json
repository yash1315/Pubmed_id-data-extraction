Although Panbio Ag-RDT has been the most frequently evaluated test, 7,9-12 the number of commercialized assays is growing exponentially. 10,13-17 Our results show that Panbio and SD-Biosensor Ag-RDTs are reliable to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection, as they fulfilled the general recommendations for the use of these tests that are recommended by the WHO \u2265 80% sensitivity and \u226597% specificity compared with PCR. 5,18 Moreover, they showed excellent performance within the first seven d.p.o. or when they are performed in samples with high viral load as well as excellent levels of agreement between them. Diagnostic performance of Ag-RDTs within the first 7 d.p.o. could be attributed to higher viral loads that are observed in these samples, as compared with samples obtained several days later, which is evidenced by observing the increasing trend of the median Cts values according to d.p.o.

Some authors have pointed out that Ag-RDTs could also be reliable for detecting asymptomatic patients with high infectious capacity. 9 These findings would support the use of Ag-RDTs as screening test for massive population testing.

However, they are not useful as point of care (POC) tests due to an excessive turnaround time for results. 1, 2 Antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) have been developed as alternative tests to PCR for COVID-19 symptomatic patients, as they could be employed as POC tests, presented a lower cost than PCR assays and could improve the turnaround time for results.

Nasopharyngeal samples were tested using one or another PCR platform indistinctly, according to the usual laboratory workflow. Samples were considered as positive when amplification was detected for all genes included inf each RT-PCR assay. Reliability of these three platforms had been previously evaluated in our laboratory, showing 100% agreement and quite similar C t values in the results for those samples that amplified all the targets covered by each technique (see",

Agreement between techniques was evaluated using the Cohen's kappa score 8 and the McNemar's test. For these comparisons, a p value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata/IC 13.1 (StataCorp).",

Both Ag-RDTs showed high values of sensitivity in samples taken within the first seven d.p.o. (87.7% for Panbio, and 90.4% for SD-Biosensor, p = 0.625). Sensitivity decreased significantly from the eighth d.p.o., reaching a sensitivity of 31.0% for Panbio and 38.1% for SD-Biosensor for day 8%-14% and 30.8% for Panbio and 38.5% for SD-Biosensor from 14 days. There were no significant differences on sensitivity results between Ag-RDTs according d.p.o. (Table 2). Finally, regarding agreement results, agreement of Ag-RDTs with PCR was moderate in overall samples (agreement = 80.9%, k = 0.596 for Panbio; 82.6%, k = 0.646 for SD-Biosensor) but it was excellent for high viral load samples (C t \u2264 25) for both Ag-RDTs (Panbio: 98.9%, k = 0.974, SD-Biosensor: 97.4%, k = 0.940).
