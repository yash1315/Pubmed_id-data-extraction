Furthermore, the interactions among these components make their relationship to the safety and efficacy much more complicated than that occurs in the western medicines. Therefore, quality evaluation of the herbal medicines, unlike that of the western medicines, is beyond the ability of routine analysis, which focuses on the single or a few marker components. Taking into account the direct quantification of as many as possible components is in common thought to evaluate the quality of the herbal medicines.
