            "text": "Across the United States public health community in 2020, in the midst of a pandemic and increased concern regarding racial/ethnic health disparities, there is widespread concern about our ability to accurately estimate small-area disease incidence rates due to the absence of a recent census to obtain reliable population denominators. 2010 decennial census data are likely outdated, and intercensal population estimates from the Census Bureau, which are less temporally misaligned with real-time disease incidence data, are not recommended for use with small areas. Machine learning-based population estimates are an attractive option but have not been validated for use in epidemiologic studies. Treating 2010 decennial census counts as a \"ground truth\", we conduct a case study to compare the performance of alternative small-area population denominator estimates from surrounding years for modeling real-time disease incidence rates. Our case study focuses on modeling health disparities in census tract incidence rates in Massachusetts, using population size estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS), the most commonly-used intercensal small-area population data in epidemiology, and WorldPop, a machine learning model for high-resolution population size estimation. Through simulation studies and an analysis of real premature mortality data, we evaluate whether WorldPop denominators can provide improved performance relative to ACS for quantifying disparities using both census tract-aggregate and race-stratified modeling approaches. We find that biases induced in parameter estimates due to temporally incompatible incidence and denominator data tend to be larger for race-stratified models than for area-aggregate models. In most scenarios considered here, WorldPop denominators lead to greater bias in estimates of health disparities than ACS denominators. These insights will assist researchers in intercensal years to select appropriate population size estimates for modeling disparities in real-time disease incidence. We highlight implications for health disparity studies in the coming decade, as 2020 census counts may introduce new sources of error.",

These studies often utilize present day disease incidence information, and seek to create incidence rates over small areas to properly characterize spatial patterns and dynamics of disease incidence. The calculation of reliable small-area incidence rates requires accurate estimates of the at-risk population size for areas and time periods coinciding with the incidence data. To investigate disparities in disease incidence across groups, demographicallystratified population size data are also needed. Public health research during the COVID-19 crisis has exemplified these challenges. In the United States in 2020, COVID-19 incidence data are available in near real time, but this is not the case for the population data, particularly for small areas.",

However, ACS data are released on a substantial delay, so that the most recent estimates available at any given time typically represent population sizes for the 5-year interval ending two years prior. The USCB also provides yearly population size estimates through its Population Estimates Program (PEP), which combines the decennial census with birth, death, and migration data (United States Census Bureau, 2020) .

Then, we conduct a study in which 2010 small-area disease incidence rates are created using 2010 decennial census population counts, and we evaluate the bias induced when ACS and WorldPop data from 2010 and from one to two years prior are used instead as the denominator in classic health disparity models. These potential biases are illustrated using both a simulation study and a real case study of racial disparities in premature mortality in Massachusetts (MA).

On the basis of these weighted data, ACS compiles 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates. To achieve reliable estimates for small areas, ACS must pool multiple years of data (Spielman et al., 2014) . 1-year and 3-year population estimates are available only for geographies with populations of 65,000+ and 20,000+, respectively. The 3-year estimates were only produced from 2007 to 2013. The 5-year estimates are produced for all census geographies except census blocks, and they are available beginning with the 2005-2009 interval (United States Census Bureau, 2014). ACS 5-year population estimates are stratified by age, sex, and racial/ethnic group (see Section S.2 for more detail). ACS population estimates are also accompanied by margins of error. Following current practice in the disease mapping literature, we do not utilize these uncertainty measures in our analyses. We focus instead on the biases arising from the issue of temporal mismatch of incidence and denominator data in standard epidemiologic models.",

Although we recognize this disclaimer by the USCB, throughout this paper we refer to ACS 5-year releases by their center year, to correspond to how they are largely used in practice, e.g., ACS 2008-2012 will be referred to as ACS 2010. USCB also cautions against comparing ACS 5-year estimates that contain overlapping years (United States Census Bureau, 2019). In spite of this guidance, USCB does provide documentation explaining how to assess trends over time using overlapping ACS data (with caveats) (United States Census Bureau, 2009). Moreover, we have also noted in longitudinal studies that ACS population size estimates from overlapping years are used to track population changes over time (Hunt & Hurlbert, 2016; Krieger, Wright, et al., 2020; Mooney et al., 2018) .

WorldPop population size estimates are created by combining census counts with geospatial covariates (e.g. land cover and night lights) for a given year to produce gridded population estimates that are at a finer scale than typical administrative units (Stevens et al., 2015; Tatem, 2017) . This process is often called \"downscaling\" of census counts (Mennis, 2009) . For years 2010, 2015 and 2020, WorldPop uses random forest algorithms to weight and disaggregate the census data onto a roughly 100 m grid (referred to as a \"top-down\" modeling approach). For other years, gridded population counts are interpolated from these three years by applying a linear growth rate (Stevens et al., 2015) . For countries without recent or reliable census data, they also conduct a second modeling step that incorporates reliable survey data (referred to as a \"bottom-up\" approach). For our analyses, we use US WorldPop estimates produced using a top-down, unconstrained estimation method (WorldPop, 2021) . More details and justification are provided in Section S.3.",

We randomly generate 100 such synthetic datasets for each of the CT-aggregate and racestratified variants.

To illustrate this phenomenon, in Fig. 2 we show the difference in decennial census and WorldPop 2010 age-stratified CT population estimates plotted against estimates of the percent of the CT in poverty (from the 2010 ACS). Roughly speaking, for a given age group, a positive relationship between these variables indicates that WorldPop tends to over-estimate population size (relative to census) for highincome CTs. Conversely, a negative relationship indicates that World-Pop tends to under-estimate population size for high-income CTs. From this Figure, it is clear that in high-income CTs, WorldPop tends to overestimate the number of young people and under-estimate the number of older people. To understand why this might happen, consider projecting the age distribution of a large and diverse county, e.g., a county containing a major city, onto each nested CT, which is WorldPop's approach. Because higher income neighborhoods tend to have fewer children and more older people (and vice-versa for low income neighborhoods), applying the age distributions of the whole city to a high income neighborhood would generally lead to over-estimation of the number of children in the CT and under-estimation of the number of older people. No such systematic biases (relative to the census) appear to exist in the ACS, as shown in Figure S .7. in ACS and 2010 census population sizes do not, on the whole, appear to diminish as the ACS year approaches 2010. Many of the largest relative changes over time are in CTs with small populations. This suggests that ACS changes over time in the total CT population size may be attributable largely to sampling variability. For CT-level Black population size estimates, we tend to see (a) much larger relative discrepancies in ACS and decennial counts and (b) much larger relative changes over time in ACS. Again, the largest relative changes tend to occur in CTs with small Black populations.",

This is in spite of the fact that, in practice, WorldPop estimates may be available contemporaneously while ACS estimates are from prior years. WorldPop's method of obtaining high-resolution agestratified population size estimates, i.e., by projecting county-level age distributions onto small area total population size estimates, proves particularly problematic for modeling health disparities.

On the other hand, changes over time in CT racial composition measured by ACS likely represent meaningful changes, and using outdated population estimates in race-stratified disparity models may induce substantial bias in disparity estimates that could lead to incorrect inference.

WorldPop relies on remote sensing data, the quality of which differs by geographic region (Elvidge et al., 2017) . ACS data quality is known to be poorer for low-income and African American populations (Spielman et al., 2014) , leading to regional differences in data quality. Thus, our findings in a single Northeastern state may not be representative of other states and regions. We are also utilizing the decennial census population counts as the ground truth population sizes for 2010. Differential undercounts in the decennial census, primarily impacting low-income and minority communities, are well-documented (Robinson, 2011; Robinson et al., 1993) . In the 2010 census, the USCB found an overall 2.1% undercount of the Black population and a 0.8% overcount of the non-Hispanic White population (United States Census Bureau, 2012).

Initiatives like the Census Post-Enumeration Survey (also called the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation or the Census Coverage Measurement Survey) and the Demographic Analysis program provide nation-level estimates of census under/overcount of various demographic groups. However, because the nature and magnitude of under/overcounting varies across space, simply scaling small-area counts to adjust for national-level under/overcount estimates is unlikely to correct the problem. Moreover, our analyses with WorldPop have revealed how attempts to produce ultra high-resolution population size estimates, by downscaling census counts and making strong assumptions about homogeneity of demographic features across space, can induce further errors that severely bias health disparity estimates.",

Moreover, USCB will, for the first time, apply differential privacy procedures to public-release 2020 census data, the consequences of which are still not fully understood for small-area disease modeling applications (Krieger et al., 2021) . These challenges will complicate future epidemiologic studies using decennial census counts as a \"gold standard\" and will necessitate novel approaches for addressing differential under/overcounts to accurately estimate health disparities. For populations age 65+, Medicare enrollment data, which are made available to researchers by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), may provide a more accurate and representative source of small-area intercensal denominator information than USCB products. Over 96% of Americans age 65+ are enrolled in Medicare (Di et al., 2017) , and the data provided by CMS contain individual-level age, sex, racial/ethnic group, and zipcode identifiers for enrollees. While Medicaid enrollment data are not similarly representative of a common population due to heterogeneity in state-level programs, these data could likely be used to create small-area-specific scaling factors to adjust for undercounts of low-income populations (including young people).",
