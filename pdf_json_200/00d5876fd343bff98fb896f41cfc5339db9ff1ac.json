Randomisation to usual care was twice that of any of the active treatment groups (eg, 2:1 in favour of usual care if the patient was eligible for only one active group, 2:1:1 if the patient was eligible for two active groups). The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis in all randomly assigned participants.

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, emerged in China in late 2019 from a zoonotic source. Most COVID-19 infections are either asymptomatic or result in only mild disease. 1 However, a proportion of infected individuals develop a respiratory illness that requires hospital care, which can progress to critical illness with hypoxaemic respiratory failure that requires prolonged ventilatory support. Among patients with COVID-19 admitted to UK hospitals, the case fatality rate is over 26%, and is in excess of 37% in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation. 2 The drug combination lopinavir-ritonavir has been suggested as an antiviral treatment for COVID-19. 3 Lopinavir is a HIV-1 protease inhibitor, which is combined with ritonavir to increase its plasma half-life. Lopinavir is also an inhibitor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) main protease, which is critical for replication and appears to be highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2. 4, 5 Lopinavir has in vitro inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. [6] [7] [8] [9] In a marmoset model of MERS, lopinavir-ritonavir improved clinical, radiological, and pathological outcomes and reduced viral loads. 10 A study of lopinavir-ritonavir in a ferret model of COVID-19 found reduced clinical symptoms in treated animals but no effect on virus titres. 11 In patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, a historically controlled study suggested that addition of lopinavir-ritonavir to ribavirin reduced the risk of adverse clinical outcomes and viral load. 12 Although some observational studies in patients with COVID-19 have reported that lopinavir-ritonavir is associated with a shorter duration of viral shedding 13 and fever, 14 other studies have reported no such effects. 15, 16 A previous randomised trial of lopinavir-ritonavir among 199 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 showed no improvement in viral load, duration of hospital stay, or mortality. 17 However, the trial was too small to rule out the possibility of clinically relevant benefits and commentators recommended larger randomised trials to confirm or refute the lack of effect. 18 Here, we report the results of a randomised trial to assess whether lopinavirritonavir improves clinical outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.",

We constructed Kaplan-Meier survival curves to display cumulative mortality over the 28-day period. We used the same method to analyse time to hospital discharge, with patients who died in hospital right-censored on day 29 (as for such patients it was known that they were not discharged alive within 28 days).

For the pre specified composite secondary outcome of invasive mechanical ventilation or death 1616 included in 28-day intention-totreat analysis within 28 days (among those not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation), the precise date of invasive mecha nical ventilation was not available and so the risk ratio was estimated instead. Prespecified analyses of the primary outcome were done separately in six subgroups defined by characteristics at the time of random assignment: age, sex, ethnicity, level of respiratory support, days since symptom onset, and predicted 28-day mortality risk (appendix p 23).

Additionally, concentrations of lopinavir in patients with COVID-19 have been reported to be substantially higher than in patients with HIV, perhaps due to inhibition of CYP3A4 metabolism by inflammation. [24] [25] [26] [27] A pharmacokinetic analysis of a range of putative SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs has predicted that lopinavir-ritonavir at the doses we used would achieve lung concentrations above the EC 90 , albeit not across the entire dosing interval. 23 Our trial, which focused on providing clear information on the effect of lopinavir-ritonavir on unambiguous clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality, has several limitations. Since the safety profile of lopinavirritonavir is well established, we did not collect detailed information on non-serious adverse reactions or reasons for stopping treatment. Neither did we collect information on physiological, laboratory, or virological parameters, which have been studied previously. 17 Finally, very few intubated patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study as there were difficulties in administering treatment to patients who could not swallow. Crushing lopinavir-ritonavir tablets for administration down a feeding tube results in unreliable bioavailability and potential tube blockage. 28, 29 Although a liquid formulation of lopinavir-ritonavir exists, it was unavailable for this study and, since the liquid formulation contains alcohol, is not compatible with the polyurethane feeding tubes that are commonly used in the UK.",
