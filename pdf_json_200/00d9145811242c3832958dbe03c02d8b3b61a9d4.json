There is a lack of provision of mouthpiece ventilation (MPV) and a lack of consensus with regard to it can be delivered, The ENMC convened the 252nd ENMC International Workshop: Developing best practice guidelines for management of mouthpiece ventilation in Neuromuscular Disorders in Amsterdam, The Netherlands from the 6th to 8th March 2020. A total of 21 participants, 19 from Europe, one form the USA and one from Canada representing a total of 11 countries. The group included respiratory physicians, neurologists, nurses, respiratory physiotherapists with a specific experience in the provision of mouthpiece ventilation (MPV) in neuromuscular disorders, advocacy groups and patient representatives were also present, with the meeting program is available as Online Supplement 1. We would like to highlight that the workshop took place at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some institutions had issued a travel ban. In such cases some individuals contributed to the meeting via Skype. All talks and discussions led to the production of the best practice algorithm to initiate MPV in patients who require daytime ventilatory support ( Figure 1 ). Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) may affect skeletal, heart and respiratory muscles. The level of respiratory muscles weakness depends on the severity and evolution of NMDs.",

MPV is not a new technique. In 1953, Dr Affeldt reported at a post-poliomyelitis conference, \"respiratory equipment provided MPV via a simple mouthpiece used for pulmonary function testing attached to an intermittent positive pressure ventilation device\" [3] .

Night time ventilation is required as a result of respiratory muscle weakness. This leads to ventilatory insufficiency initially during rapid eye movement sleep due to selective inhibition of the accessory muscles of breathing. As the weakness progresses abnormalities in ventilation will occur during all stages of sleep and subsequently progress to daytime hypercapnic respiratory failure. Treatment with NIV at night will correct gas exchange and normalise blood gases [5] . Some patients will develop daytime hypercapnia and subsequently require daytime ventilatory support. Prior to commencing daytime ventilatory support it is Best practice to check that the patient is optimally ventilated overnight and using their device for the full period when they are asleep. It is recommended that patients are monitored over night with carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) (measured by arterial blood gas, end tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2 ) or transcutaneous CO 2 (TcCO 2 ) and oximetry.",

The group would like to point out that sometimes the driver for a tracheostomy maybe dependent on what the centre has done historically and whether it was inserted due to an acute episode. In some countries having a tracheostomy leads to provision of round the clock care and in some instances this maybe by a nurse rather than a career. In other countries the insertion of a tracheostomy may lead to living in a care institution rather than independent living. Sometimes the driver for a tracheostomy is when secretions are troublesome and cannot be cleared with effective proximal airway clearance techniques or for the face to be free of a mask. MPV is an alternative to an interface on the face. There have been no randomised studies showing that either technique is superior in terms of survival. The group concluded for best practice that patients should be given a trial of MPV prior to consideration of tracheostomy. In the first instance nocturnal ventilatory support should be optimised and along with proximal airway clearance techniques [6, 7] . If a long-term tracheostomy is indicated then it should be the choice of the patient and not the doctor.",

During volumetric MPV, the feedback loop is long, resulting in slow reactivity of the ventilator to changing loads, tidal volume overshoot during circuit disconnection, followed by a down-regulation of the ventilator's working pressure and a lower-than-expected delivered tidal volume in the subsequent cycles [13] . Similar changes can be observed between controlled and assisted ventilatory cycles even without circuit disconnection, with the ventilator adapting slowly to the changing muscular effort performed by the patient. This phenomenon varies significantly between the available ventilators, needing 2 to 6 cycles to stabilize tidal volume, and is particularly evident when a backup respiratory frequency is set [14] .",

MPV once started can prolong tracheostomy-free survival, up to 9.5 months [22] . However, only 19% ALS patients are able to successfully use MPV [22] . There are two factors that determine the success of the MPV; the presence of an effective assisted cough peak flow (CPF) capable of clearing secretions and the presence of sufficient bulbar function to retain a mouthpiece and achieve an adequate seal around it avoiding air-leaks and allowing an adequate Ventilation. As bulbar function worsens over time, MPV becomes ineffective and can be assessed by the maximum insufflation capacity (MIC) greater than their vital capacity.",

With the introduction of emerging therapies (gene therapy and Nusinersen) the natural history of the disease is changing and whilst MPV may have been used in SMA type II [31] , it may be possible in SMA type I (bulbar function depending). In children who require daytime ventilatory support the advantage of a MPV over having a nasal mask include; prevention of mid facial hypoplasia, prevention or improvement in pectus excavatum. There may also be an impact on self-image with an increased ability to speak in class and participation. It maybe that children are better started in pressure support mode. This maybe because of concerns around barotrauma with volumes. However, volumes may be needed to assist in improving pectus excavatum. MPV is possible in the groups experience in children over the age of 8 years old. However, if a clinician wanted to start in children younger MPV can be trialled. MPV In SMA has also been reported to normalised ABG's [31] .

Based on the MPV survey use of MPV in other NMD's is common in congenital myopathies (n=60), cervical spine injury (n=46), myotonic dystrophy (n=30). Less commonly but, used in congenital muscular dystrophies and Pompe's disease. The group believes that all patients should be assessed on an individual basis and not be excluded from a trial of MPV due to there being no studies in this patient group.",

In normal individuals, the swallowing process is highly synchronized and the initiation of breathing immediately after swallowing occurs at a higher lung volume and is immediately followed by exhalation. This results in a positive subglottic pressure that is thought to be protective against aspiration [33] . In individuals with diffuse NMD the careful sequencing of swallowing can be lost, and, even in those without bulbar dysfunction, respiratory muscle weakness can lead to swallowing dysfunction likely through inability to develop a positive subglottic pressure [34] . Discoordination of pharyngeal and laryngeal swallowing sequences can occur as well as inhalation rather than exhalation occurring immediately after swallowing which increases the risk for aspiration. Garguilo et al., showed that nasal NIV improved swallowing function in DMD by increasing the number of swallows followed by expiration, reducing swallowing fragmentation and improved dyspnoea during swallow [35] . In a qualitative study of swallowing, subjects reported that MPV improved swallowing compared to spontaneous breathing and that nasal NIV was more difficult that MPV to use during eating [36] .",

Advised MPV mode Volume is 1st choice mode and allows: air-stacking, leaks NIV without untimely leak compensation 6 B. Suggested tidal volume Volume is presented as \"starting value (range)\". For a child, starting values can be 300 mL, for an adult DMD: 500-600mL, for an ALS patient: 1000mL 6 C. Suggested inspiration time Inspiration time is presented as \"starting value (range)\" 6 D. Suggested trigger MPV dedicated trigger is a high sensitive flow interruption trigger, classic flow trigger (high or medium sensitive) is less sensitive 6 E. Evaluation of NIV dependence In many countries in Europe, NIV use >16/24 hours defines NIV-dependence 6 F. Suggested rate Comfortable free time can be estimated as >4-6 consecutive hours without NIV 6 G. Suggested disconnection alarm Apnoea alarms may be set in the very dependent patients (example: alarm after 5 minutes with apnoea) 6 H. Choice interface Choice of the mouthpiece according to patient preference after trial with both pieces 6 I. Choice tubing support Custom support on the shoulders is advised for dependent patients.",

The wheelchair must be able to accommodate a strong and safe system for the ventilator and a fastening solution to ensure that the tubing/circuit/arm and the mouthpiece will be held in place. The main objectives are comfort, safety, battery life and manoeuvrability for the patients and their caregivers.Recently, ventilator companies developed a ventilator mode specially dedicated for MPV with dedicated arms and circuits without expiratory valve allowing the patient to exhale outside the mouthpiece[29]. Another advantage of this arms and circuits is the practicality to support and hold the mouthpiece in perfect position and easiest way to adapt it to a wheelchair. Nowadays the ventilator industries provide us life support ventilators with 8 hour battery, and the possibility of external batteries providing battery life up to 16 hours.",

Patients are asleep when using nigh-time ventilation and lying down. During sleep there is decreased ventilator autonomy and their ventilatory support needs to capture this. In the day patients are awake, moving around, eating, drinking, socialising and coughing, leading to a different ventilation requirement highlighted by different daytime and night-time settings. The daytime ventilator needs to be portable and easily adapted to fit on to the wheelchair with good battery provision.
