In this work, we presented our experience in incidental detection of COVID-19-associated pneumonia in asymptomatic patients coming for routine oncologic 18 F-FDG PET/CT examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic, which contribute in the detection of the affected patients early to be isolated and properly managed. We reported the cases with incidental finding of COVID-19 pneumonia among 764 asymptomatic patients who were referred for whole-body 18 F-FDG PET/CT examinations for routine oncologic indications in the period between 15 March and 15 June 2020, and RT-PCR testing for them was requested for confirmation. Results: Among the 764 scanned patients, we had recognized 87 patients (11.3%) having features of COVID-19 pneumonia. RT-PCR testing of them confirmed COVID-19 infection in 78 cases, yet 3 were negative and no RT-PCR testing was performed in 6 cases (only isolated and carefully monitored). Conclusion: 18 F-FDG PET/CT is sensitive for early COVID-19 detection, even in asymptomatic patients that guide proper management and also highlight the key role of a radiologist and the importance of applying safety measures in clinical services during the pandemic to minimize the spread of infection.",

            "text": "Background COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin that occurred initially in Wuhan, China, during December 2019, and then spread worldwide, becoming a pandemic [1] [2] [3] . The most common manifestations of COVID-19 clinically include fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, and fatigue. However, others may initially or entirely remain asymptomatic and significantly propagate infection in the community [4] . Although reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID- 19 infection, yet false negative results are not uncommon (sensitivity 60-70%) [5, 6] . Therefore, another examination with higher accuracy is needed to improve the detection of affected patients during the pandemic. Radiology can be helpful by identifying the pattern of pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 in chest radiologic studies [7] . CT chest findings, which consist of multiple mainly subpleural ground-glass opacities (GGOs) or consolidations, typically describe COVID-19-associated pneumonia [8, 9] . While 18 F-FDG PET/CT examinations are not used in the primary diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, yet incidental detection of patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia in asymptomatic but infected cases referred for 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans for other oncologic indications may necessitate further management for the patients and the health care workers [10] . This also illustrates the importance of strictly applying the recommended containing measures to limit the spread of viral infection by accurate cleaning and sterilization of the imaging room at the end of each procedure and providing adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) to all patients and to the staff members [11] .",

The Chinese authorities expanded the official definition of COVID-19 infection to include patients with typical CT findings, even with a first negative RT-PCR result [13] . Common CT findings of COVID-19-associated pneumonia have been widely reported and sometimes appeared even before the clinical symptoms become evident. Thus, high-resolution chest CT is considered a preferred tool for screening, diagnosis, severity assessment, and monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia [14] [15] [16] . Early in the disease, single or multiple pulmonary subpleural nodular or segmental ground-glass opacities and consolidations were found that enlarged and spread centrally as the disease progressed. They may be accompanied by dilated pulmonary vasculature, air bronchogram sign, crazy-paving sign, reverse halo sign, interlobular septal thickening, pleural effusion, reactive LNs, and others. These CT features may be similar to those seen in other viral pneumonia such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [17] . 18 F-FDG PET/CT is a nonspecific nuclear imaging tool, used mainly for oncologic patients for the detection and staging of many malignant tumors [18] [19] [20] .
