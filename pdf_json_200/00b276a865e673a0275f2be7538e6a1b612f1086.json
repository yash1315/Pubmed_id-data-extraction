The gynecologic oncologist must decide between performing primary surgery and pursuing an alternative approach. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and debulking interval surgery are valid alternatives in patients at higher risk for complications. One of the main objectives of surgical treatment is to predict whether the surgical team will be able to perform optimal cytoreduction. 8 Higher CCL5 levels are associated with lower histological differentiation, higher tumor invasion depth, more frequent lymph node involvement, and higher tumor stage. 10 CCL5 is highly expressed and secreted by tumor and tumor stromal cells. Evidence supporting the relationship between CCL5 and the progression of ovarian cancer has also been demonstrated by studies that analyzed chemokine levels in patients' plasma at various disease stages. 11 CCL5 appears to influence the optimality of ovarian cancer cytoreduction.",

            "text": "In a meta-analysis of 14 studies including patients with stage III-IV ovarian cancer, Kang et al found that CA-125 as a predictor of suboptimal cytoredutcion has sensiivity value 68.9% and specificity value 63.3%. 15 In addition, several studies have also evaluated HE-4 as a predictive marker in cytoreduction surgery; a study by Tang et al found that a cutoff HE-4 value of 473 pmol/L had a sensitivity value 81.0 % and specificity value of 56%. 16 Chemokine C-C ligand 5 (CCL5) is a chemokine that has promoted tumor development by changing the tumor microenvironment in some in vivo and in vitro studies. In addition to modulating the recruitment and activity of immune cells, CCL5 also aids in angiogenesis, which depends on vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). 17, 18 CCL5 can promote cancer cell growth, stimulate cell proliferation by inducing the mTOR pathway and the subsequent rapid upregulation of cyclin D1, c-Myc, and Dad-1 expression or by increasing glucose uptake followed by increased ATP production and glycolysis. 19 Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are a heterogeneous population of myeloid cells that contribute to immunosuppression, tumor formation, persistence, and metastasis. 20 CCL5 plays an active role in the recruitment of leukocytes, such as T cells, macrophages, eosinophils, and basophils, to the site of inflammation. Together with specific cytokines released by T cells, such as interleukin-2 and IFN-, CCL5 also induces the activation and proliferation of specific natural killer cells to produce C-C chemokine-activated killer cells. 21 Angiogenesis is a prerequisite for tumor growth and invasion. CCL5 exerts a proangiogenic role by promoting endothelial cell migration, spread, new vessel formation, and VEGF secretion. Additionally, in response to CCL5 stimulation, tumor cells can produce VEGF or, through CCL5 secretion, can recruit TAM expressing CCR5. In turn, TAM can induce angiogenesis by secreting VEGF. 20 Chemokine binding to G-protein-coupled receptors activates a series of downstream effects that facilitate receptor internalization and signal transduction, leading to integrin activation (adhesion) and polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. The consequences are directional sensing, cell polarization, accumulation of Rac/Cdc42 GTPase signaling and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, polymerization of actin, and formation of F-actin. These changes lead to the contraction of actomyosin, retraction of the ends of filaments, and, ultimately, cell migration. More specifically, in lung cancer, CCL5 contributes to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin activation and cell migration via phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT, which in turn activates IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB. 22 ",

            "text": "In ovarian cancer, CCL5 can induce the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 by monocytes, causing matrix degradation and allowing extravasation of tumor cells. 23 In gastric cancer, higher levels of CCL5 are associated with lower histologic differentiation, a higher depth of tumor invasion, more frequent lymph node involvement, and advanced tumor stage. 10 A recent retrospective analysis of 105 patients with gastric cancer found that elevated serum CCL5 levels were correlated with advanced T and N stages, poor histological type, peritoneal metastasis, higher residual tumor, and shorter survival. The group with high CCL5 levels also had stronger CCL5 immunohistochemical staining in tumor tissues and metastatic lymph nodes. 21, 24, 25 Thus, high serum CCL5 levels, together with strong CCL5 immunohistochemical staining and poor differentiation, can be used to predict peritoneal spread and worse prognosis. CCL5 is also a useful genetic marker that can be utilized to predict chemotherapy efficacy for better prognosis and survival outcomes in gastric cancer. 23 The serum CCL5 cutoff point was 53,170 (Table 2) . Serum CCL5 values >53,170.00 indicate a greater likelihood of suboptimal cytoreduction surgery. In contrast, when serum CCL5 values were < 53,170.0, optimal cytoreduction surgery was predicted. This cutoff value had a sensitivity of 61.3%, a specificity of 68.3%, a positive predictive value of 59.4%, a negative estimated value of 70%, and an accuracy of 65.7% ( Table 2 ).",

This study has several limitations. We did not examine all histological subtypes of ovarian cancer or patients with stage I-IV cancer [which, incidentally, is possible in the early stages with complete surgical staging (complete cytoreduction)] and were therefore unable to distinguish whether CCL5 is directly related to high stage or histological subtype. Importantly, higher levels of CCL5 have been shown to be associated with lower histologic differentiation, higher depth of tumor invasion, more frequent lymph node involvement, and advanced tumor stage in gastric cancer. 10 Other studies have also found that plasma CCL5 levels are higher in patients with ovarian cancer than in those with ovarian cysts; CCL5 levels have also been shown to be higher in stage III-IV ovarian cancer than in stage I-II ovarian cancer. 13 In addition, our hospital ceased performing cytoreduction in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic.
