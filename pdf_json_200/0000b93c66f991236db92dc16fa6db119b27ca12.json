The conditioning regimen affects the HSCT recipient by influencing the natural physical barriers to infections such as the skin and mucosal integrity as well as hematological components which prevent infection from occurring, namely, the myeloid and the lymphoid cells in the blood and bone marrow. Harvested bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells is infused through a central vein which then home in on the marrow and subsequently engraft in about 2-3 weeks to generate hematopoietic cells. The pre-engraftment phase (the phase in which infused hematopoietic stem cells are yet to produce functional and viable neutrophils, macrophages, etc.) is the most critical from the point of view of bacterial and fungal infections. During this phase as well as during the phase of conditioning till the initiation of transplant and subsequent engraftment, the patient has to be nursed in HEPA-filtered positive-pressure isolation rooms which should have differential air pressure of 2.5 pascals and air exchange of 12 air exchange cycles per hour. Room temperature should be around 22 C with humidity ranging between 40% and 60% and air particle count of less than 1000 particles per cubic feet of air (Bhalchandra et al. 2015) .",

This can facilitate migration of normal flora through the tissue into the blood stream. Maintenance of oral hygiene using sodium bicarbonate solution or octenidine mouth wash is essential at all times especially during the course of mucositis. When mucositis subsides, chlorhexidine mouthwash or octenidine solution may be used. All patients undergoing HSCT require introduction of a central venous access for infusion of hematopoietic stem cells, optimal fluid and electrolyte management, provision of nutrition (total parenteral nutrition), energy (glucose infusion), antibiotics, and other medications. The site for central line insertion should be chosen after careful consideration, for example, a Hickman catheter inserted into the subclavian vein is preferable over internal jugular venous catheter or a femoral venous line. The chance of infection generally increases in the above sequence with the least being for the subclavian site and maximum for femoral venous site. Because of the high prevalence of resistant, multiresistant, and extremely drug-resistant organisms in the Indian setting, antibiotic prophylaxis is generally not recommended. Rather an antifungal prophylaxis using one of the following is generally given. Antifungal prophylaxis is usually administered as per defined guidelines, and this includes the use of either fluconazole, voriconazole, or micafungin. Antiviral prophylaxis using aciclovir is given to prevent reactivation of Herpes viruses (HSV 1/ HSV 2, VZV). In the era of posttransplant surveillance using quantitative CMV PCR, antiviral prophylaxis against CMV is generally not administered. Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is offered using co-trimoxazole twice weekly after the period of engraftment till the first 100 days posttransplant. In the Indian setting, prophylaxis against the reactivation of mycobacterial infection is generally not given because of high prevalence of latent or asymptomatic infection. It is important to screen patients for Hepatitis B core antibody pretransplant so that those reactive can be given lamivudine or entecavir prophylaxis (Shang et al. 2016) .",

Candida BSI can also occur because of the presence of neutropenia, use of central lines, total parenteral nutrition, neutropenic enterocolitis, and GVHD (graft-versus-host disease), which may occur in the posttransplant period.

In view of the high mortality associated with the treatment of CMV disease, a variety of preemptive or prophylactic strategies are employed to reduce the incidence of CMV disease. This includes checking CMV IgG reactivity (both in donors and transplant recipients) before transplantation, use of leucodepletion filters to exclude reservoirs of CMV in leukocytes, use of antiviral prophylaxis such as aciclovir or valganciclovir, and regular surveillance of CMV viral load titers using quantitative PCR. The risk of CMV reactivation is highest in those with CMV serostatus: D\u00c0/R+ followed by D+/R+ and least for D+/R-. CMV reactivation if it occurs may manifest either as a mononucleosis syndrome with nonspecific febrile illness, myalgia, and a maculopapular rash or as organ-specific CMV disease which may manifest as CMV pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, encephalitis, retinitis, and hematological disturbances. CMV reactivation can also lead to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and similarly the onset of GVHD or its treatment may precipitate a CMV reactivation. When CMV reactivation is detected during viral load monitoring (CMV surveillance), it has to be treated in the preemptive mode even before the onset of organspecific CMV disease. CMV pneumonitis is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Many of the patients with CMV pneumonitis may require respiratory support in the form of invasive or noninvasive ventilation. CMV pneumonitis may be complicated by simultaneous occurrence of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis is generally done by demonstration of CMV viremia, clinical and radiological involvement of lung, and demonstration of CMV in bronchoalveolar lavage, endotracheal secretion, and sputum by qualitative CMV PCR. In rare cases, CMV pneumonitis may occur without CMV viremia. This disease, like other CMV diseases, must be treated aggressively with use of intravenous ganciclovir, cidofovir, or foscarnet. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIgnormal human immunoglobulin or the more expensive and not readily available CMV-specific immunoglobulin) could be considered as an adjunctive treatment in management of CMV pneumonitis. If CMV-specific immunoglobulin is available and can be afforded, it would be a better choice in management of this condition. CMV colitis manifests generally as diarrhea and abdominal pain along with CMV viremia. Colonoscopic features are suggestive, and biopsy from suspected areas of colon affected by CMV colitis may show CMV inclusions by immunohistochemistry techniques. CMV hepatitis, pancytopenia, and retinitis are other manifestations of CMV disease. The CMV hepatitis is mild but may be superimposed over veno-occlusive disease of the liver and liver GVHD. For management of CMV retinitis, ophthalmological referral is warranted, and in addition to intravenous ganciclovir, intravitreal ganciclovir impregnated implants may have to be considered. The choice of antiviral in management of CMV reactivation depends upon the neutrophil count, renal function of host, and tolerability of oral agents (not useful in case of diarrhea or intestinal GVHD) (Devasia et al. 2018) .",

Monitoring the patient for drug-induced toxicities is essential, and these may be manifested as nephrotoxicity, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia in the case of ganciclovir, while electrolyte imbalance and nephrotoxicity may be commonly seen in the case of foscarnet and cidofovir.

These reactivations are largely preventable by aciclovir prophylaxis which is given to all patients in the peri-transplant period. However, if breakthrough infection or reactivation occurs despite prophylaxis, the dose of aciclovir has to be augmented from prophylactic range to therapeutic range. Intravenous treatment with aciclovir is indicated in serious infections and in those who are unable to take oral medications because of malabsorption or mucositis. The dose of aciclovir used to treat HSV reactivation varies between 200 and 400 mg orally five times a day, and, if required, intravenous formulation at a dose of 5 mg/Kg body weight thrice daily may be administered. VZV infection or reactivation in immunocompromised setting may be complicated with pneumonia, hepatitis, and encephalitis. Even in uncomplicated infection or reactivation in peritransplant period with VZV, it is recommended that aciclovir is administered through intravenous route at 10 mg/Kg body weight thrice daily for 7 days at least. A patient with VZV reactivation or primary infection, if in the hospital, should be nursed in a negative pressure isolation room which has separate air vents for the outlet air. It is important to note that viruses including VZV may not be filtered by HEPA filters and the only way to ensure effective isolation of the infectious patient is through appropriate ventilation systems. VZV pneumonitis has higher morbidity and mortality and may require artificial ventilation and ICU admission. In case of such patient, it is important that, only staff immune to VZV be involved in their care to prevent occurrence of secondary cases among staff and other caregivers. This may be ensured either through a history of chicken pox or zoster or history of VZV vaccination or demonstration of anti-VZV IgG antibody levels by enzyme immunoassay (EIA).

Among the atypical pathogens, Legionella is the most important cause of infection acquired in healthcare setting because the organism can proliferate and get transmitted from shower heads and other water supply points which are liable for stagnation, low chlorination, and inadequate or inappropriate temperature control of water. Legionella contamination of hospital water supply is preventable and controllable through chlorination, water heating, and point of use bacterial filters of 0.2 \u03bcm pore size. Among the respiratory viral infections, only influenza A and B are preventable through yearly vaccination (John et al. 2018 ). Influenza vaccine compositions are different for northern and southern hemispheres. For the countries located in the tropics, it needs to be checked from the WHO website if the circulating strains in these countries in a given year are of northern or southern hemispheric variety, so that appropriate vaccine could be selected for vaccination of vulnerable patients.",

The diagnostic method used for fungal infections includes simple techniques based on light microscopy and culture to more complex tools such as antigen detection assays by ELISA and molecular assays like PCR and MALDI-TOF. Candida infection in HSCT patients may manifest as a candidemia which could be primaryas a result of CLABSI, secondary form primary infection in another organ, or MBI-LCBI (mucosal barrier injury laboratory-confirmed blood stream infections) in neutropenic patients including those with GVHD (graft-versus-host disease).The incidence of candidiasis has significantly reduced in recent years after the introduction of effective antifungal prophylaxis. However infection still occur especially those due to improper central line handling, particularly in those patients receiving total parental nutrition (Roychowdhury et al. 2016) . The drug of choice for the treatment of candidemia and disseminated candidiasis is echinocandin which has to be administered intravenously. The minimum treatment of candidemia and disseminated candidemia is 2 weeks but may have to be prolonged to 4-6 weeks in case of deep-seated infection such as hepatosplenic candidiasis, renal candidiasis, candida brain abscess, and infective endocarditis. Surgical drainage may have to be attempted in some cases if feasible. However, surgical intervention may not be feasible in those with severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation abnormalities. The choice of echinocandin will depend on clinical consideration such as potential for hepatic dysfunction and drug interaction. Anidulafungin is an echinocandin which can be administered in patient with liver or renal dysfunction without causing further organ derangement or need for dose modification. The mortality from candidemia remains high (about 40% -30-day all-cause mortality) despite the institution of appropriate antifungal therapy. One of the reasons for the high mortality in candidemia is the occurrence of septic shock in some patients with candida blood stream infection. Delay in the institution of appropriate antifungal therapy in those patients with adverse APACHE IV score or SOFA score may negatively influence clinical outcome and prognosis (Goel et al. 2017) .",

Apart from lungs, other organs that could be involved with aspergillosis include the brain, paranasal sinuses, ear, kidneys, and skin, nail, and subcutaneous tissue. The drug of choice for the treatment of aspergillosis is voriconazole which may be administered orally or intravenously. The institution of treatment generally follows diagnosis as per the EORTC-MSG criteria which classify fungal infections into proven, probable, and possible group (Hoenigl et al. 2012) . This classification would require histopathology, high-resolution CT scan, and galactomannan antigen testing by ELISA (along with other host factor, clinical criteria, and microbiological criteria for the diagnosis of mycosis). The duration of treatment of aspergillosis is generally between 3 and 6 weeks depending upon the organ involvement, extent of disease, and response to antifungal therapy. Therapeutic drug level monitoring (TDM) is desirable while treating patient with voriconazole. This is because polymorphism of the cytochrome-based metabolic pathways has shown variation in metabolic rate of voriconazole. There could be also variation in drug level due to drug interaction and suboptimal oral absorption and bioavailability. Voriconazole is generally administered as loading dose 400 mg twice daily in the first day followed by 200 mg twice daily from subsequent days.",

Most of such infections are preexisting pathology but need to be checked for and adequately treated before starting transplant conditioning. Dermatophyte infections should be treated with terbinafine 250 mg administered orally daily or by an azole such as Itraconazole or voriconazole. The duration of treatment depends on the site of involvement, the extent of the disease, and response to antifungal therapy. For example, onychomycosis involving the finger nails should be treated for at least 6 weeks, whereas those involving toenails should be treated for 3 months.",

Incidence of PCP has reduced after the introduction of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis (Wilkin and Feinberg 1999) . PCP generally presents with dry, nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, fever, and dyspnea on exertion. There is a notable fall in oxygen saturation on exertion. After exercise for 10 min, oxygen saturation may fall below 90% (S O2 < 90%). Chest X-ray or high-resolution CT scan often shows diffuse perihilar or interstitial infiltrates, and arterial blood gas analysis may show partial pressure of oxygen to be less than 11 kilo pascal while the patient breathes room air (normal range should be 11.7-15.3 kilo pascal). Definitive diagnostic of PCP is by microscopic examination of induced sputum or BAL sample. Microscopy may demonstrate cyst either by Giemsa or Grocott stain (silver stain) or by immunofluorescence. More sensitive diagnostic test include PCR, but it is liable to give false-positive because of contamination or may not correlate clinically because of detection of Pneumocystis colonization in the upper respiratory tract. Diagnosis of PCP requires high index of clinical suspicion. Consultation with pulmonologist is essential for consideration of bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) in a timely manner. The drug of choice for management of PCP is co-trimoxazole administered at the dose of 20 mg per kg per day of trimethoprim and 100 mg per kg per day of Sulfamethoxazole. Co-trimoxazole is preferably given intravenously for PCP management but may be given orally as well if intravenous formulation is not available. Dose adjustments should be done as per renal and hepatic function. The duration of treatment with cotrimoxazole is 21 days and should be administered along with corticosteroid such as prednisolone orally or methyl prednisolone IV during treatment.",

In endemic regions, transfusion of blood and blood products can lead to certain parasitic infection such as malaria, babesiosis, and Chagas disease besides bacterial and viral infections (Basu et al. 2015) . This is relevant for those patients who have traveled to endemic regions for healthcare or tourism. The common parasitic infections are gastrointestinal, and they could be common agents like giardia and entamoeba or due to agents which are more likely to affect immunocompromised patient. The diagnosis of many parasitic infections is by microscopic method. However newer techniques like antigen detection test and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) such as PCR are also becoming popular and available. Coccidian parasites in stool (such as Cryptosporidium) are detected using modified acid fast staining. Treatment of cryptosporidiosis involves use of nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily for 3 days. Other options include paromomycin, azithromycin, or combinations of these drugs. Isosporiasis and cyclosporiasis are treated using co-trimoxazole 960 mg orally twice daily for 10 days. Alternatives are ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 7 days. For giardiasis the treatment including use of tinidazole 2 gm per orally single dose or metronidazole 400 mg three times daily for 7 days. Treatment of microsporidial infection is done using albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 2-4 weeks. Strongyloidiasis is treated using either ivermectin at a dose of 200 microgram per kg per day for 3 days and should be repeated after 2 weeks. Toxoplasmosis treatment includes use of co-trimoxazole at 60 mg per kg per day and should be divided into two doses. Alternatives are combination of clindamycin 600 mg 4 times daily intravenously or orally along with pyrimethamine 100 mg single dose and then at 50 mg daily PO. Folinic acid at 10-25 mg per kg per day should be used in this regimen. Malaria with suspected Plasmodium falciparum in chloroquine-resistant regions should be treated with artemisinin combination therapy (artemether/lumefantrine: 480 mg) four tablets as a single dose and then again after 8 h followed by four tablets twice daily for another 2 days. Each tablet contains 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine and should be taken with food. Severe cases of Plasmodium falciparum infection should be treated with intravenous artesunate followed by doxycycline. In malaria due to chloroquinesensitive infection (Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium ovale) 1 gm or 600 mg of chloroquine base should be administered and repeated at a dose of 500 mg after 6 h and then 500 mg daily for another 2 days (Jarque et al. 2016 ).",
