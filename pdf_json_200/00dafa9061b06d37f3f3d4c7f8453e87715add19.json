            "text": "COVID-19 was first recognised in Peru in March, 2020, 1 and caused more than 90 000 deaths with more than 1 million confirmed infections by Aug 15, 2020, with presumably millions more infected but undetected. 2 One component of an effective public health response to the pandemic is determining what proportion of the population remains susceptible and immune to the virus and assessing the duration of protection; these questions are best answered through seroprevalence surveys. 3 The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicates previous exposure 4 and most of these individuals are protected against reinfection, with very few reported exceptions. 5 SARS-CoV-2 infections are either symptomatic, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic; asymptomatic individuals have similar viral loads to those who are symptomatic 6 and have a considerable role in transmission of the disease. 7 Without symptoms, most asymptomatic infections are not detected, except in seroprevalence studies. Nevertheless, seroprevalence estimates vary widely depending on country and risk groups. For example, some states such as San Francisco in the USA reported seroprevalence as low as 0\u00b726%, 8 Wuhan, China had 3\u00b72-3\u00b78%, 9 Switzerland had 11%, 10 New York City, NY, USA had 19%, 11 and more recently the highest was reported in Manaus, Brazil, with 55\u00b71-61\u00b74%. 12 In Peru, preliminary results from two sero prevalence studies have been reported: one study done in July, 2020, reported a seroprevalence of 29\u00b77% in the region of Lambayeque; 13 and another done in December, 2020, found a seroprevalence of 39\u00b73% in the regions of Lima and Callao using population-based sampling techniques. 14 We aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Iquitos, Peru, one of the first and hardest-hit cities in the country during the pandemic. In Iquitos, over two-thirds of the total excess deaths occurred during 1 month (April 19-May 18, 2020), including the deaths of 23 physicians, and the health-care system faced collapse due to the shortage of medical oxygen, health-care staff, and hospital beds. 15 Iquitos is a city of about 467 000 inhabitants, located in the region of Loreto in northeast Peru (appendix 2). The city has four districts, San Juan to the south, Belen to the east, Punchana to the north, and Iquitos in the centre. 16 As with most Peruvian Amazonian cities, Iquitos is accessible from the coast only, by air or by boat, and is situated 120 m above sea level at the confluence of the Amazon, Itaya, and Nanay rivers. The climate is tropical rainforest, with daily temperatures of 22\u00b70-32\u00b72\u00b0C; the coldest months are typically June and July (21\u00b70-31\u00b71\u00b0C), and the warmest months are October-December (mean 26\u00b72\u00b0C [range 22\u00b75-33\u00b71\u00b0C]). The mean annual precipitation is 3\u00b76 m; the rainiest months are typically December-May. According to the latest census, Iquitos is among Peru's poorest regions, with more than 60% of Iquitos's population classified either as poor or extremely poor. The region's principal industries are oil, tourism, agriculture, fishing, and lumber. Iquitos's health-care infrastructure includes one military clinic, one military hospital, three public hospitals, and nine public clinics located in Iquitos's urban areas. Most of Iquitos is urban, with several surrounding small communities considered rural if their total population is less than 2000 residents, by Peruvian Government census definition. The Peruvian Government is currently providing full coverage for COVID-19 health care, so these patients receive medical attention free of charge. The regions have had an autochthonous transmission of all four distinct dengue virus serotypes since 1990, with serotype 2 currently the most predominant. 16 Yellow fever is endemic in the region, 17 and Zika virus was introduced into Iquitos in late 2016. 18 This study was done by the Directorate of Epidemiology, Executive Directorate of Prevention and Control of Diseases, and Regional Directorate of Health of Loreto, following the public health emergency in April and May, 2020, when more than 1000 Iquitos residents, including more than 50 health workers, died during the first wave of the pandemic. We aimed to assess seroprevalence to help inform decision making and mitigate the further impact of COVID-19.",

Most countries are progressing towards their second or third waves of COVID-19, and Peru has one of the highest numbers of excess deaths and mortality after facing one of the most lethal first waves in the world. Across the country, one of the most affected areas was Iquitos, which faced the collapse of its health system in the space of a few weeks. Official statistics suggest that a sizeable population of asymptomatic, non-care-seeking individuals with infection were not detected by the regional surveillance system. By not accounting for these infections, the official estimates of the COVID-19 burden are underestimated. In the absence of a vaccine, the probability of a second wave or third wave depends on the protective herd immunity conferred by how many of the population have already been infected and the duration of such immunity. Hence, it became crucial to assess the COVID-19 seroprevalence in Iquitos, which we aimed to do in this study. At the time of study conception in June, 2020, the highest seroprevalence was reported by New York City, NY, USA, which reported a seroprevalence of 19%. Since then, many studies in other countries have reported seroprevalence estimates ranging from 0\u00b73% to 61\u00b74%, but none have exceeded the presumed herd immunity threshold of about 70%.",

Moreover, it is notable that we observed significantly higher seroprevalence among children aged younger than 12 years than among adults aged 30-59 years, despite school closures and strictly mandated restrictions on social gatherings during the study period. Furthermore, we observed that COVID-19 seroprevalence among children aged younger than 12 years in Iquitos was as high as that among adults aged older than 60 years.",

We aimed to obtain a representative sample of the population of each of the four districts, five age groups, and two sexes of interest, so we weighted the sample by district, sex, and age group. In each district, we sampled each sector, and in each sector, we selected random households. In each household, we aimed to identify an individual of a specific age group and sex. If participants were not available, we moved to the next nearby household from right to left until we found an eligible individual. We invited eligible individuals to participate, and all those who gave their informed consent were surveyed. We attempted to screen each of the cohort participants during the first week of each month for 3 consecutive months, July, August, and September. Additionally, we reported the regional excess death counts reported by the Peru National Death Registry Information System (SINADEF) to contextualise the study.",

Sampling effects were calculated to weight for the district population and population distribution by sex and age groups (<12 years, 12-17 years, 18-29 years, 30-59 years, and \u226560 years). The sample size was approximately 400 participants to estimate a seroprevalence of 18% with a precision of plus or minus 2\u00b75% (50% relative error) at the 95% confidence level. In anticipation of a 20% response rate, 20% loss to follow-up, and 20% missing values, the minimum sample size increased to 692 participants. On the basis of this estimate, we decided to enrol 726 participants, to account for a 5% loss of information due to contingencies such as robberies, assaults, or similar. Blue shaded areas represent the periods during which we did the study baseline and 1-month follow-up assessments. Death counts only include those reported as non-violent death due to any cause, which during the pandemic was reported as the most robust and most reliable signal to track the COVID-19 epidemic in Peru. We did a descriptive analysis summarising each participant's demographics and clinical history with absolute and relative frequencies if categorical and with mean and SD if continuous. We used Student's t test for mean comparisons and Fisher's exact test for proportion comparisons between those who tested seropositive versus those who tested seronegative. Then, we estimated the seroprevalence using a two-step process. First, we estimated the seroprevalence by accounting for the survey sampling weights using STATA survey (svy) commands and, second, we adjusted these estimates to account for the reported sensitivity (95\u00b78%) and specificity (100\u00b70%) of the test using the diagnostic (diagti) command. Finally, we explored factors associated with three outcomes of interest: COVID-19 seropositivity (defined as positive test result at baseline), test-retest positivity (defined as positive at baseline and positive at the 1-month follow-up), and incidence of new COVID-19 exposure (defined as negative at baseline and positive at the 1-month follow-up). For all outcomes, we estimated the prevalence ratio as the magnitude of association of interest using log-binomial regression models with robust variance and 95% CI.

            "text": "Our findings from this population-based cohort study indicate that the seroprevalence of IgG or IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was approximately 70% in Iquitos in July, 2020. Because the study was designed to obtain a representative sample from Iquitos inhabitants, we observed differences across age groups consistent with the literature. Notably, we observed significantly higher seroprevalence among children aged younger than 12 years than among adults aged 18-29 years, despite school closures and strictly mandated restrictions on social gatherings during the study period. Furthermore, we found that seroprevalence for COVID-19 among children aged younger than 12 years was as high as that among adults aged 60 years or older. To our knowledge, our study describes one of the highest seroprevalences of COVID-19 in the world. Previously, high seroprevalence estimates were reported in Mumbai, India, and Manaus, Brazil. In Mumbai, between June 29 and July 19, 2020, local researchers reported a seroprevalence of between 55\u00b71% and 61\u00b74% using a population-based sample. 20 In Manaus, using blood donor samples, researchers reported a seroprevalence of between 44% and 66% in July, 2020. 12 In other areas, population-based studies have reported lower estimates, and a wide range of seroprevalence estimates across cities, including 0-25\u00b74% in Brazil, 21 and 1\u00b72-14\u00b74% in Spain. 22 With a population of around 426 000, Iquitos was one of Peru's cities that were hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iquitos, in the first week of May, 2020, the regional authorities declared a major health crisis with more than 100 deaths per day, which totalled around 2500 registered deaths either confirmed (about 1200) or suspected (about 1300) and many more deaths of indigenous people who had traditional unregistered burials. Despite government efforts, hospitals became overwhelmed, and medical oxygen shortages contributed largely to these deaths. The tragic news reports gave us a sense of the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis in Iquitos. Known as the world's largest city that cannot be reached by road, Iquitos suffered a COVID-19 epidemic of catastrophic proportions, but there was imprecision in exact case counts and incomplete death attribution. Our study estimates show that most Iquitos inhabitants were infected with COVID-19 before our baseline measure in July, 2020. However, transmission did appear to continue at a low level, as seen by a slight increase in seroprevalence in the test-retest findings. Despite such high seropreva lence, both Iquitos and Manaus have experienced second waves starting in January, 2021, probably due to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 P1 variant in Manaus, which has shown higher transmissibility and reinfection rates. 23 We found no differences in seroprevalence between women and men, between districts, or between those living in rural or urban areas of Iquitos. However, it is essential to note that many small rural communities surround Iquitos, and that we did not measure how high the sero prevalence is across the rural areas of Loreto. By contrast to seroprevalence estimates reported previously, we observed the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among children, teenagers, and adults aged 60 years or older, and the lowest seroprevalence among adults aged 18-59 years. This observation seems counterintuitive given that children in most similar studies had lower prevalence presenting with lower nasal gene expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. 24 A possible explanation for these findings is that, since Iquitos is one of the poorest cities in Peru, most citizens do not have potable water and sanitation, and only a tiny fraction have the means to preserve their food refrigerated. These scarce resources mean that most families need to trade or buy food daily, which exposes children to the community to a greater extent than in different social contexts. This point is particularly relevant because, in mid-May, 2020, the Peruvian Ministry of Health did a series of surveillance studies on the country's largest markets using the same test used in our study, and found a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 99\u00b79% among the sellers at the Belen market.",

For example, in mid-August, 2020, it was estimated that the pooled seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at a global level was 3\u00b738% (95% CI 3\u00b705-3\u00b772), with Latin America having just 1\u00b745% (0\u00b795-1\u00b794). 27 These estimates meant that the risk of a second and third wave, in the absence of a vaccine, remained high, and given the marked variability of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among and within geographical regions, such waves would be likely to vary substantially.",

Furthermore, the study might be overpowered because the high seroprevalence was four times higher than expected and included several data quality control methods, including a test previously used 22 and properly validated for seroprevalence studies, 19 double test result reading, and double data entry to prevent information bias. Even though 13% of participants were lost to attrition at the 1-month follow-up, all four districts were adequately represented in our study. Regardless, we adjusted our estimates by the sampling effect and the imperfect diagnostic test results and did multivariable regression analysis to minimise confounding bias. Participation rates were slightly lower in rural areas, but this was compensated by the high seroprevalence observed across all Iquitos regions. Additionally, it is important to highlight that the diagnostic certainty of the test was assessed only among symptomatic patients, 19 so its sensitivity might be lower among asymptomatic patients. Our analysis only detected IgM and IgG antibodies, but the extent of the immunity these antibodies provide is uncertain, with cellular immunity also having a part in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. 28 Furthermore, we observed a decrease, although small, in the proportion of people with antibodies after 1 month of follow-up. Similar findings have been reported previously as a problematic characteristic of the weak humoral protection conferred by previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure and a natural decline in the sensitivity of rapid tests for COVID-19 over time. 29 During the first wave of COVID-19, Latin America became the epicentre of the pandemic, with Brazil and Peru as the worst-case scenarios, despite their different control approaches. While Brazil mostly decided to pursue herd immunity, Peru implemented one of the longest and strictest lockdowns early in the pandemic. However, Iquitos was one of the last cities in Peru to enforce the lockdown policies and experienced one of the most tragic COVID-19 epidemics worldwide. In less than 4 weeks, in the Iquitos COVID-19 epidemic peak, cases increased by six to eight times and deaths increased by four to five times, reaching the highest mortality in Peru at the time.",
