The aims of this study were not only identifying the factors associated with the polarised COVID-19 pandemic in Japan but also discussing effective preventive measures. Methods: This was an ecological study using online survey data which was cross-sectionally conducted by the author. A total of 6000 respondents who resided in 10 low-and 10 high-COVID-19 incidence prefectures, with a wide gap in terms of COVID-19 incidence, in Japan were recruited. Data on COVID-19 cases and geodemographic information were obtained from official government sites. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare variables between the two areas and age groups.",

The major factors significantly associated with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people were 'commuting by private automobile' (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.444; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.394-0.501), 'commuting by public transportation' (AOR, 6.813; 95% CI, 5.567-8.336), 'washing hands' (AOR, 1.233; 95% CI, 1.005-1.511), 'opening windows regularly' (AOR, 1.248; 95% CI, 1.104-1.412), 'avoiding crowded places (AOR, 0.757; 95% CI, 0.641-0.893), 'non-scheduled visits to drinking places' (AOR, 1.212; 95% CI, 1.054-1.392) and 'perceived risk of contracting COVID-19' (AOR, 1.380; 95% CI, 1.180-1.612). These factors were strongly associated with age groups. Conclusions: Effective preventive measures for COVID-19 transmission can be developed by understanding the characteristics of populated areas, such as public transportation infrastructure and younger people's movements and behaviours in relation to the population age structure to contain the current epidemic and protect the most vulnerable elderly people.",

Did Japanese cultural factors, such as people's awareness on issues related to COVID-19 and subsequent changes adopted in daily practices, influence the incidence of COVID-19? In addition, how does the age structure of the population influence people's preventive behaviours and perceptions, widening the gap in COVID-19-incidence rates between the bottom 10 (low-incidence areas) and top 10 (high-incidence areas) prefectures? To answer these questions, this study aimed to identify the possible factors associated with the incidence gap between low-and high-incidence areas to establish more effective advocacy measures for managing COVID-19, considering the Japanese population's age structure.",

In Japan, the proportion reached 28% in 2019 [10] . This study revealed the existence of a significant negative correlation between 'CASES per 100,000 on 02/05/2020' and the proportion of the population aged \u2265 65 years in Japan. The correlation coefficient with the cumulative COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population on 2 May 2020 was \u2212 0.701 (p < 0.001). In the 10 prefectures with low COVID-19 incidence, the median proportion of the population aged \u2265 65 years was 30%, and the proportions in 4 of the10 prefectures exceeded 30% (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, in the same area, the proportion of younger people (18-29 years) was extremely low, with a median of only 9.8%. Their proportion in nine of the 10 prefectures was less than 10%. The proportion above makes it clear that there was a polarization of population age structures between the low-and high-incidence areas. Besides population density, the polarised nature of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan was associated with age specific people's behaviours and perceived risk of contracting COVID-19. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3 , 'age' influenced people's behaviours and perceptions, except regarding 'wearing facemasks'. Older adults are less likely to commute by public transportation and to visit places where alcohol is served than younger people. In addition, they are more likely to wash hands and to avoid the 3 Cs, even though their perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 was relatively lower than that among younger people. In contrast, the proportion of individuals from the population group of aged 18-29 years who avoided all the 3 Cs was < 30% in both areas, despite the higher perceived risk of COVID-19. The proportion was far less than the target set by the Japanese government of 70% to 80% [4] .",

In low-COVID-19-incidence area, public transportation was not convenient because of insufficient infrastructure. Therefore, it is common for residents in such areas to use their private cars to commute. In contrast to the low-incidence area, high-incidence area had developed public transportation networks commonly used for commuting. The characteristics of public transportation in high-incidence area are well described in consideration of the 3 Cs, as Iwasaki et al. [5] mentioned that social distancing was negligible during rush hours in trains and buses. Therefore, 'commuting by public transportation' was positively associated with high-incidence area, whereas 'commuting by private automobile' was negatively associated with the area. These two variables strongly influence the incidence of COVID-19, as shown in Table 4 . In addition, 'nonscheduled visit to drinking places' was positively associated with high-incidence area, while 'going eat' was insignificantly associated with the high-incidence area. Generally, in the drinking spots, people may have difficulties to avoid 3 Cs, particularly avoiding close-contact setting such as close-range conversations. Also, under an influence of alcohol, people are less likely to practice preventive measures due to impaired normal judgements by the alcohol intake [12] .",

This does not necessarily mean that they are the main source of virus transmission, because once an older person gets infected, his/her mobility will be lowered due to an increased risk of severe illness and/or death [16, 17] . The source of transmission, except in clinical settings, might be much younger individuals. Compared with the low-incidence area, the highincidence area had more individuals aged 18-29 years. Younger people are more likely to be asymptomatic and transmit SARS-CoV-2 due to their numerous social activities [18] [19] [20] [21] . Thus, it may not be entirely wrong to conclude that younger people are the source of COVID-19 transmission. Additionally, in Japan, the observed gap between low and high COVID-19 incidence was associated with the population age structure as discussed earlier. The results of this study suggest that age-specific strategies should be established, and an approach to fill the gaps in the understanding of preventive measures should be subsequently developed.",

The sample size was not decided by population-based proportionate sampling; instead, it was decided with the intention to maximise the number of participating individuals aged \u2265 60 years and 18-29 years. Therefore, each prefecture sample was weighted using age-specific proportions of the population by sex and size. As only 300 samples were collected from each prefecture, it was challenging to analyse each prefecture situation; therefore, all analyses were carried out using aggregated data from low-and high-incidence areas and younger and older age groups. This study covers up to 87-year-olds and 89-year-olds in low-and highincidence areas, respectively. The author believes that many older people who could not be included in this study are less active due to an age related state of frailty; thus, their ability to prevent COVID-19 should be much less than that of the study respondents except the cases who contracted COVID-19 as a nosocomial infection while staying at day-care centres or hospitals. Therefore, it is necessary to keep it in mind when the study implications are interpreted. However, it is very challenging to access older individuals for interviews in Japan.",

Effective preventive measures for COVID-19 transmission, particularly advocacy campaign, can be developed by understanding the characteristics of populated areas, such as public transportation infrastructure and younger people's movements and behaviours in relation to the population age structure to contain the current epidemic and protect the most vulnerable elderly people. Finally, in Japan, the rates of wearing facemasks in both low-and high-incidence areas were very high (94% in both areas), with no statistically significant differences between the rates. This study could not test its efficacy in containing COVID-19, although, several studies have shown its efficacy [22] [23] [24] .",
