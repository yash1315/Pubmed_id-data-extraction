We have focused on vaccines that are expected to elicit immune responses in the population older than 65 years: over threequarters of deaths caused by SARSCoV2 infection are in this older population, 1,2 so it is essential that any vaccine is able to protect this group. Scalability of vaccine manufacture was also a key criterion, with the goal being to manufacture in the UK, if possible, to secure supply and create longterm resilience. We considered only vaccines that have the potential for approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and European Medicines Agency and for vaccine delivery as early as the end of 2020 or, at the latest, in the second half of 2021.",

The most advanced vaccines, such as those developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, BioNTech and Pfizer, and Janssen, are based on novel formats for which we have little experience of their use as vaccines, although the initial immunogenicity and safety data are encouraging. [3] [4] [5] Vaccines based on frequently used vaccine formats, such as adjuvanted protein vac cines developed by Novavax, and by GSK and Sanofi, and inactivated whole viruses developed by Valneva, will not be available until late in 2021.",

The precise dose required will be determined as part of the clinical trials and by the decisions made by the UK Government on the basis of the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.

These studies have the potential to assess the efficacy of vaccines more quickly and with far fewer participants than a standard phase 3 trial.
