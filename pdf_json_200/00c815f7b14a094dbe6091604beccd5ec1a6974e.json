Our objectives were to determine (i) the percentage of malnutrition, and (ii) its prognosis in patients admitted for coronavirus disease 2019 . In this monocentric retrospective study, we consecutively included all adult patients presenting with acute COVID-19 between 9 April and 29 May 2020. Malnutrition was diagnosed on low body mass index (BMI) and weight loss \u2265 5% in the previous month and/or \u2265 10% in the previous six months. The Nutritional Risk Index (NRI) defined nutritional risk. Severe COVID-19 was defined as a need for nasal oxygen \u2265 6 L/min. We enrolled 108 patients (64 men, 62 \u00b1 16 years, BMI 28.8 \u00b1 6.2 kg/m 2 ), including 34 (31.5%) with severe COVID-19. Malnutrition was found in 42 (38.9%) patients, and moderate or severe nutritional risk in 83 (84.7%) patients. Malnutrition was not associated with COVID-19 severity. Nutritional risk was associated with severe COVID-19 (p < 0.01; p < 0.01 after adjustment for C reactive protein), as were lower plasma proteins, albumin, prealbumin, and zinc levels (p < 0.01). The main cause of malnutrition was inflammation. The high percentage of malnutrition and the association between nutritional risk and COVID-19 prognosis supports international guidelines advising regular screening and nutritional support when necessary.",

BMI was calculated using the formula weight (kg)/height 2 (m 2 ). Weight was measured within 24 h following admission. Patients were questioned about their current height and their weight one and six months before admission in order to calculate the weight variation. This information was checked in their medical chart when available. Malnutrition was considered as moderate or severe. Severe malnutrition was defined by BMI \u2264 17 kg/m 2 (or \u2264 18.5 kg/m 2 if age was \u2265 70 years) and/or weight loss > 10% in the previous month and/or > 15% in the previous six months. Moderate malnutrition was defined by BMI in the range 17.0-18.5 kg/m 2 (or 18.5-21.0 kg/m 2 in people \u2265 70 years) and/or weight loss 5 to 10% in the previous month and/or 10 to 15% in the previous six months. Nutritional risk was assessed by calculating the nutritional risk index (NRI): 1.519 x albumin (g/L) + 0.417 \u00d7 (measured weight/usual weight) \u00d7 100 [22] . Malnutrition risk was classified as either no nutritional risk (NRI \u2265 97.5%), moderate nutritional risk (NRI 83.5-97.4%), or severe nutritional risk (NRI < 83.5%). Plasma albumin level was routinely measured at admission according to SFNCM guidelines (see the biological paragraph Section 2.5).",

According to the GLIM conference [26] , disease-or injury-related malnutrition is due to a combination of reduced food intake or assimilation and varying degrees of acute or chronic inflammation. Indeed, food intake was largely reduced in our population with COVID-19: the reduction in food intake over the last week was more than 50% for 56.3% of the patients. Considering the mean delay between the first symptoms and admission of approximately a week, this observation may suggest that nutrition support should be provided before admission to every COVID-19 patient. Reduced food intake may partly rely on gustative dysfunction and digestive symptoms experienced in some patients with COVID-19, but there was no significant association of these symptoms with malnutrition. Inflammation contributes to malnutrition through anorexia and decreased food intake. It alters metabolism by elevating and increasing muscle catabolism [30] . Finally, only a few patients had severe underlying comorbidities exposing to chronic malnutrition, meaning that malnutrition in COVID-19 results from an acute event.",

Indeed, the NRI was significantly and proportionally associated with severe COVID-19 in our series, even after adjustment for age.",

            "text": "Nutritional risk is a combination of hypoalbuminemia and weight loss, which are the results of the combined effects of inflammation and inadequate protein and caloric intake. Inflammation induces anorexia, reduces the effective use of dietary protein and energy intake, and augments catabolism of the key somatic protein, albumin [33] . In a large cohort of 2645 patients from the emergency room, elevated parameters of inflammation and high nutritional risk were independently associated with hypoalbuminemia, but all three parameters independently predicted mortality [34] . Therefore, inflammation could fully explain both an increased NRI and a poor prognosis. However, the NRI adjusted for CRP level remained associated with severe COVID-19, meaning that neither inflammation nor age entirely explained the association. In addition, albumin levels were not associated with severe COVID-19 at admission. This suggests that a low albumin level, and therefore low NRI, might not reflect current but future severity. On the contrary and in agreement with previous COVID-19 studies [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , we found an independent association between age, initial infection presentation, inflammatory biomarkers, and infection severity, suggesting that the poor prognosis associated with nutritional risk is partly driven by inflammation [30] . Therefore, we think that nutritional risk and malnutrition are partly a consequence of COVID-19, but might also expose to a higher risk of severe disease and help identify the patients who need particular attention.",

At this time, the COVID-19 pandemic thankfully decreased in our region. Nevertheless, we could include 108 patients, and this number was sufficient to show an association between low BMI, weight loss, NRI, nutritional biomarkers, and COVID-19 severity. Our population was not representative of all COVID-19 patients, as we only investigated patients admitted for acute infection. Therefore, information only applies to critically ill patients, with symptoms too severe to stay at home because of either respiratory symptoms or severe comorbidities, but not severe enough to be transferred into the ICU or to directly require tracheal intubation. This population looked more prone to malnutrition than ambulatory patients who were less likely at risk for malnutrition and severe pneumonia. On the other hand, ICU patients usually have malnutrition independently of the disease [44] , and could not be questioned about their weight loss.",
