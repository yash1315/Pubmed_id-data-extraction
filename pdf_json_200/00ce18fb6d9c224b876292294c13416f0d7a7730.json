We approximate the solution of the model using the numerical scheme developed by Toufic and Atangana. The numerical simulation corresponding to several fractional orders shows that, as the fractional order reduces from 1, the spread of the endemic grows slower. Optimal control analysis and simulation show that the control strategy designed is operative in reducing the number of cases in different compartments. Moreover, simulating the optimal profile revealed that reducing the fractional-order from 1 leads to the need for quick starting of the application of the designed control strategy at the maximum possible level and maintaining it for the majority of the period of the pandemic.",

The insight that the transmission dynamics of endemic diseases can be formulated using mathematical language dates back to 1766 when Daniel Bernoulli published a paper where he described the effects of smallpox variolation on life expectancy [1] . Other early mathematical models in epidemiology were introduced in 1927 when Kermack and McKendrick published a series of papers that described the dynamics of disease transmission in terms of a system of differential equations [2] .",

In other words, in the case of fractional-order derivative, since it involves derivatives and integrals of arbitrary real or complex orders, the future state depends on the present and previous states.

The recently developed Atangan-Baleanu fractional derivative and Toufic-Atangana numerical scheme [27] are used to develop the fractional derivative version of the model and estimate its numerical solution. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the SEAIR endemic model applying the Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivative is not yet investigated. The authors also argue that optimal control analysis of mathematical models in the sense of Atangana-Baleanu fractional operators is uncommon in the existing literature. As a result, in this study, we consider an optimal control analysis of the SEAIR model. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we accomplish the description and formulation of the model. In Sect. 3, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the model including the positivity and boundedness in the sense of the Atangana-Baleanu fractional operator. Section 4 deals with the diseases-free and endemic equilibrium points and the corresponding global stability analysis. The numerical solution of the SEAIR model via Atangana-Baleanu numerical scheme and simulation is detailed Sect. 5. In the last section, we consider an optimal control analysis of the fractional model by incorporating a control parameter in the model. Moreover, in this section, we perform a numerical simulation verifying the effect of the designed control strategy for different values of fractional order and different compartments of the model.",

To this end, we give several numerical simulations of the model using a numerical technique developed by Toufic and Atangana as shown in equations (26)- (30) . We took some approximations to the real values of the parameters given as Figure 2 shows that decreasing the fractional order of derivative \u03b7 from 1 leads to flattening the curves of the suspected cases (S) with a few decreases in the number of cases in the compartment. As the value \u03b7 gets smaller and smaller, the number of cases approaches the constant value S 0 .",

In other words, the curves for each of the compartments E, A, I, and R get flattened as \u03b7 reduces from 1 to 0.6 as shown in the figures. We can conclude that as \u03b7 gets close to zero from the right, the number of cases in E, A, I, and R gets close to zero. It must also be noted that the EEP for fractional order and the integer order are the same and the solution of the fractional order tends to the EEP over a longer time. From Figs. 2-6 it seems that as the fractional derivative gets smaller and smaller, the time it requires to approach to the EEP gets longer and longer. That is, when the derivative order is reduced from 1, the memory effect of the dynamic system increases, and, consequently, the infection in each of the compartments increases slowly for a long time. Hence the fractional derivative order \u03b7 affects the dynamics of infection of model (3b) at least in this work. The peak period of the compartments E, A, R, and I is prolonged, and the number of cases at the peak is reduced as \u03b7 reduces from 1 to zero (see Figs. 3-6). the result obtained in this study for the SEAIR model by using the Atangana-Baleanu fractional operator with results that could be obtained by applying the other fractional operators for the same model can be a gap for future work.",

The intermediate values u(t) \u2208 (0, 1) quantify the effect of applying the intervention mechanisms. In this model, the purpose of incorporating the control variable is reducing the number of exposed, asymptomatic, and symptomatic individuals by a factor of (1u). Model (3b) is modified to (31) after incorporating the control variable:and the main objective is to find the control optimal unit u(t) such that the following control objective function is minimized:where a is a nonnegative weight for the endemic diseases, and b measures the relative cost of interventions over the range of [0, T].The objective is minimizing the number of exposed, symptomatically, or asymptomatically infected cases while minimizing the cost of control uTo solve (31) and (32) , we derive the necessary optimality conditions for the problem.To do this, we define the scaler Hamiltonian functionwhereFollowing [14] , in equations (34)-(37), we obtain the necessary optimality conditions for the system of equations (31) and (32):with transversality conditionsSolving the system of equations (34) is the same as solving (31) , and solving the system of equations (35) is the same as solving the system of adjoint equations given byAccordingly, the optimal control u * (t) of a dynamic system (31) , which minimizes the objective functional (32) , is characterized byMoreover, the fractional derivative state equation (31), the fractional derivative adjoint equation (38) , together with the characterization of the optimal control (39) and the boundary conditions (37) , are the optimality systems.

As can be seen from Figs. 7, 8, and 9, the number of cases in the compartments of E, A, and I, declined significantly as compared to Figs. 3-5, which are simulated without application of the control strategy. However, the curves exhibit different asymptotic behaviors for different values of the fractional derivative \u03b7. The difference in the asymptotic behavior of the curves for different fractional orders is also observed in the optimal profile of the control function depicted in Fig. 10 for different values of \u03b7. The decrease in the number of cases in E, A, and I after applying the control strategy verifies the efficiency of the proposed optimal control strategy.",
