A prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, with two doses was given 4-6 weeks apart. The primary outcomes for this substudy were safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine, as determined by serious adverse events and solicited local and systemic reactions. Humoral responses were measured by anti-spike IgG ELISA and antibody-mediated live virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated immune responses were measured by ex-vivo IFN-\u03b3 enzymelinked immunospot assay (ELISpot) and T-cell proliferation. All outcomes were compared with an HIV-uninfected group from the main COV002 study within the same age group and dosing strategy and are reported until day 56 after prime vaccination.

The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to be brought under control only by a combination of public health interventions and effective vaccination. There are increasing data on the efficacy of different vaccines; however, most evidence for protection derives from studies of adults who are not immuno compromised. [1] [2] [3] Although some countries are already reporting a beneficial effect of vaccination on COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality, 4 many are concerned that individuals with less functional immune systems (eg, those with cancer or recovering from organ trans plantation) might have more severe disease 5 and respond less well to vaccination. 6 For people living with HIV, successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in undetectable plasma HIV viraemia and restoration of CD4 cell numbers, improving mortality and morbidity. 7 Clinically significant immune dysfunction can be reversed and prevented with daily ART, 8 but full immune reconstitution might not be possible and many patients have persistent T-cell activation and exhaustion for many years. 9, 10 Responses to vaccination for people with HIV might also be suboptimal despite ART, short-lived, 11, 12 and require adjusted vaccine schedules. 13 Because of the benefits of ART, nonreplicating vaccines (including those licensed for SARS-CoV-2) can be given to all people with HIV, although replicating vaccines, such as yellow fever, should be avoided in those with CD4 counts below 200 cells per \u00b5L. 14 An additional theoretical concern is that vaccine-induced immune activation can promote HIV viral transcription from latency with potential to increase the number of cells latently infected with HIV (the so-called viral reservoir), 15 although the benefits of vaccination seem to outweigh this risk.",

More recently, several studies from countries, including the UK, North America, and South Africa, [16] [17] [18] [19] have suggested otherwise. For people with HIV, and particularly those from Black and minority ethnic groups or with comorbidities, mortality due to COVID-19 has been speculated to be higher than for the general population. 16 No studies have proven this hypothesis definitively, and the role of comorbidities (which might themselves be a result of HIV infection) remains a confounder. As a result, some groups have advocated to prioritisation of people with HIV for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. 20 Few data exist on immune responses to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in people with HIV. We studied the safety and immunogenicity of vaccination in participants with HIV on ART with CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per \u00b5L receiving two doses, 4-6 weeks apart, of a non-replicating chimpanzee adenovirusvectored vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (ChAdOx1 nCoV -19) , which has proven efficacy in people without HIV infection. 1",

Comparison was made with participants who were HIV negative, aged 18-55 years, enrolled into the main COV002 phase 2/3 randomised clinical trial, and randomly assigned (5:1) to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or MenACWY by intramuscular vaccination. The dose of vaccine administered was the same across both groups. Only participants receiving the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine were used for comparison. Full details of the COV002 HIV-negative cohort have been published previously. 22 Before enrolment, all participants attended a screening visit where a full medical history and examination were done, in addition to blood tests to exclude biochemical or haematological abnormalities (full blood count; kidney and liver function tests). Participants with a history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by anti-N protein IgG immunoassay (Abbott Architect, Abbott Park, IL, USA) at screening were excluded. Subsequent study visits were scheduled at days 0 (vaccine prime), 7, 14, 28 (vaccine boost), 31, 35, 42, and 56. Participants were asked to complete diaries reporting solicited systemic and local adverse reactions for 7 days after both their prime and boost vaccinations. Adverse events were recorded at all visits. Blood samples for immunological analysis were collected on days 0, 14, 28, 42, and 56.",

An ELx808 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments; Winooski, VT, USA) was used to provide optical density measurement of the plates at 405 mm. Standardised EUs were determined from a single dilution of each sample against the standard curve, which was plotted using the 4-Parameter logistic model (Gen5 version 3.09; BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).

Assays were done using Multiscreen IP ELISpot plates (Merck Millipore, Watford, UK) coated with 10 \u03bcg/mL of human anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibody and developed using streptavidin alkaline phosphatase antibody conjugate kits (Mabtech, Stockholm, Sweden) and BCIP NBT-plus chromogenic substrate (Moss, Pasadena, MA, USA). PBMCs were separated from whole blood with lithium heparin by density centrifugation within 4 h of venepuncture. Cells were incubated for 18-20 h in RPMI (Sigma) containing 1000 units per mL penicillin, 1 mg/mL streptomycin solution, and 10% heat-inactivated, sterile-filtered FCS, previously screened for low reactivity (Labtech International, Healthfield, East Sussex, UK) with a final concentration of 10 \u00b5g/mL of each peptide. A total of 253 synthetic peptides (15mers overlapping by ten amino acids) spanning the entire vaccine insert, including the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence, were used to stimulate PBMCs (ProImmune, Oxford UK). Peptides were pooled into 12 pools for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein containing 18-24 peptides, plus a single pool of five peptides for the tPA leader. Peptides were tested in triplicate, with 2\u00b75 \u00d7 10\u2075 PBMCs added to each well of the ELISpot plate in a final volume of 100 \u03bcL. Results are expressed as spot forming cells (SFCs) per million PBMCs, calculated by subtracting the mean negative control response from the mean of each peptide pool response and then summing the response for the 12 peptide pools spanning S1 and S2. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (0\u00b702 \u03bcg/mL) and phyto haemagglutinin-L (10 \u03bcg/mL) were pooled and used as a positive control. Plates were counted using an AID automated ELISpot counter (Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH, algorithm C) using identical settings for all plates, and counts were adjusted only to remove artifacts. A lower limit of detection of 48 SFCs per million PBMCs was determined on the basis of the minimum number of spots that could be detected. To define a positive response for categorical analyses, a definition of greater than 221 SFCs per million PBMCs was used.",

Additionally, vaccination might itself lead to T-cell activation and increased HIV viral transcription from the latent reservoir. To explore this, co-expression of CD38 and HLA DR was used as a marker of CD4 and CD8 cell activation and was measured at all timepoints. We found a small but significant increase in immune action for both CD4 and CD8 cells at day 14 after prime vaccination, but this response was not sustained beyond this timepoint (appendix p 9). Additionally, immune activation at baseline (on CD4 or CD8 cells) had no effect on subsequent serological or cell-mediated vaccine responses (appendix p 8).",

These findings suggest that no dose adjustment in the vaccine is needed for people with HIV on ART with CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per \u03bcL. Although this study was too small to report protection from infection, the measured immuno logical responses are similar to those seen in larger studies of HIV-negative participants for whom there is increasing evidence that vaccination leads to a reduction in symptomatic cases and hospital admissions, [25] [26] [27] including to variants of concern such as B.1.1.7. 28 As of June 17, 2021, vaccine roll-out against SARS-CoV-2 is continuing in all countries, and although there are concerns over the potential impact of new variants, there are clear beneficial impacts on hospital admissions and deaths related to COVID-19. 5,28-30 However, individuals with primary or secondary immuno defic iencies are a population of particular concern because they have increased rates of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality and might respond less well to vaccination. For people with HIV, the relative risk of disease pro gression, admission to hospital, or death related to COVID-19 is not clear, with several observational studies reporting different results. [16] [17] [18] [19] 29, 30 This is likely partly related to the heterogeneity of outcomes for individuals with HIV, contingent on access to effective suppressive ART. We studied participants at two major UK NHS centres for HIV care, all of whom were on long-term ART with undetectable viraemia and CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per \u00b5L. Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 had a favourable safety profile with no serious adverse events, and symptoms that were reported within 7 days of vaccination were generally mild or moderate. The pattern of reactogenicity was very similar to a population without HIV who received the same vaccine schedule. Although some solicited symptoms appeared to be less frequent for people living with HIV, the comparator group without HIV were an earlier cohort of participants who had been vaccinated in the context of a single-blind randomised study 25 and were not advised to take paracetamol if symptomatic after vaccination. Additionally, the HIV-positive cohort were all male, compared with only 52% being male in the HIVnegative cohort, so the findings might have been affected by sex differences in reactogenicity profiles.",

Further follow-up will take place after 6 and 12 months to determine how the vaccine responses are sustained in people with HIV, which is of importance in light of evidence of shorter-lived responses to some vaccines in this population. 31 However, in view of concerns regarding the potential for worse outcomes with COVID-19 for people with HIV combined with anxiety over less effective immune responses to vaccination, these preliminary data showing good early immunity are reassuring. Second, this was an open-label study without randomisation and there was no parallel recruitment of adults without HIV at the same centres. Instead, we used data from adults without HIV recruited to the COV002 trial using the same vaccine protocol. Although there was an imbalance in the sex distribution of the people with HIV study group, the cohorts were otherwise similarly matched for age and ethnicity. We have previously found equivalent responses in males and females using this vaccine protocol, 32 and a South African study in which 69% of a cohort of individuals with HIV receiving vaccination were female showed similar results. 33 Accordingly, we do not think the sex difference in this study had a substantial effect on the outcome.",
