We describe the set-up of the VITOM\u00ae exoscope system based on our 5 years' experience of using it as an effective intraoperative video imaging and teaching modality for extraocular surgery. Methods The VITOM\u00ae is a specially designed exoscope mounted onto a versatile mechanical arm. It is attached to a high definition (HD) digital camera displayed on the HD video monitor of a standard endoscopy stack. This technology has been utilised in other surgical subspecialties, but there is no documented use within extraocular surgery.",

The theatre team were able to view the precise surgical steps, contributing to improved theatre flow. Trainees reported that the VITOM\u00ae images significantly improved their visualisation and understanding of key surgical anatomy and steps. Conclusions Our experience showed that the VITOM\u00ae exoscope is an excellent intraoperative video imaging and teaching aid, as it allows real-time capture and editing of open surgery and seems to improve theatre flow. With newer models using 3D stereoscopic vision, it could be further evaluated as a heads-up viewing system within extraocular and oculoplastic surgery.",

An L shaped articulating stand (catalogue number 28172 HC) is secured within the rail clamp and consists of its own central clamp with all five joint functions. A quick-release KSLOCK\u00ae (female) allows further manipulation of the exoscope. At the proximal end of the articulating stand, a clamping jaw (catalogue number 28172 UGK) with a ball joint and quickrelease KSLOCK\u00ae (male) secures the exoscope, providing fine adjustment in three planes of space intraoperatively. The movable, operating-table fixated device's camera is positioned above and in front of the patient's head, (25-60 cm working distance) away from the surgical field, which does not interfere with the surgeon's manoeuvres or operating field. This allows for the observation of detailed anatomy, including fine vascularisation, the lid margin and tissue planes (Fig. 3) .

Intraoperative sterility is maintained with the use of a sterile image intensifier drape which covers the mechanical arm, exoscope, camera and light pipe. This sterile drape is adapted to accommodate the exoscope tip by cutting out a small hole in one corner and securing it with a 2.5 cm sterile adhesive tape. This allows the surgeon full flexibility to adjust the exoscope and camera position, thereby achieving the desirable field for each procedure. Sterile access to the mechanical arm and camera controls allows recording and editing in real time. This feature is difficult to achieve without using an operating microscope, which is often not ideal or practical for oculoplastic surgery. The exoscope and light pipe can be autoclaved and stored in a wire tray (catalogue number 39501A2), when not in use.",

Future developments in technology might herald the use of 3D viewing platforms and it also has the potential to replace surgical loupes by providing a heads-up display system. Although the headsup approach is used in other surgical disciplines, further evaluation would be required regarding its suitability in Oculoplastic surgery. This might be worth further exploring given the current challenges we face with the current Covid-19 pandemic. This could potentially offer a greater working distance compared to surgical loupes which traditionally allow a working distance between 30 and 40 cm. Step-by-step guide to setting-up the exoscope.",
