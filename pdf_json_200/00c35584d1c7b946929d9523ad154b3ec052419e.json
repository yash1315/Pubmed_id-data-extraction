The research, carried out through informal, online consultations still in progress, revealed indicative trends in the discourses of 83 Christian leaders of local communities in various Brazilian states that influence, guide, and reflect the practice of the faithful in their communities. The main motivations which the leaders emphasized when mobilizing people to care for the poor were sought and what kinds of concrete actions the churches or Christian communities have carried out under the influence of these leaders in the face of the emergency situation. Initial results showed that the impact of the pandemic generated emergency assistance mobilizations for the poor, conducted institutionally, primarily in local communities; analyzed in the light of the Weberian categories of social action, the motivations endorsed by the leaders for these mobilizations revealed that rationality has given way to tradition and emotion when dealing with a social emergency. Finally, we found that while the social criticism present in the discourses of these leaders identifies economic inequality in the structures of society and emphasizes the need for action by religious institutions, they are nonetheless still minimal in terms of alternatives for a broader mobilization that would bring about transformations in the social structures of inequality in the country.",

The survey consulted 83 Christian leaders over a 10day period (July 02-11, 2020), who responded anonymously to an online questionnaire of closed, open-ended, and hybrid open-ended questions that sought to address the issue of poverty in the discourse and practices of leaders of local churches or Christian communities. The sampling was indicative of certain trends in the current Christian reality from the perspective of these leaders given the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and it aimed to provoke reflections on the social question, verifying the alignment of these discourses with the praxis of Christians as mediated by their religious leaders in the face of the global crisis. We sought the main motivations that the leaders refer to in mobilizing people to care for the poor, the personal conceptions of these leaders regarding poverty, and what kinds of concrete actions the churches or Christian communities under the influence of these leaders have taken in the face of the emergency situation.",

According to the IBGE, the vacancy rate from 2016 onwards reached 11 to 12% (IBGE 2020b, 4) . In 2019, while the number of economically active people in Brazil was estimated at 106.2 million, 11.6 million people remained unemployed, compared with 6 to 6.5 million between 2012 and 2014. By 2020, underemployment and informality had risen even further (IPEA 2019, 8) . Gizzi and Mendon\u00e7a consider it obvious that the growth of underemployment and informality implies greater inequality and concentration of income (Gizzi and Mendon\u00e7a 2020, 235) . According to the authors, it is possible to infer an unequal accumulation of capital based on FGV/IBRE 2 data from 2019, according to which the wealthiest 1% of Brazilians received an average of R$27,744 per month in 2018, against R$820 per month for the poorest part of the population. In the authors' understanding, neoliberal policies of labor deregulation have deepened the differences between rich and poor due to weak economic growth, progressive deindustrialization of the economy, low productivity, slow recovery of the labor market, increased informality, and the proliferation of precarious labor contracts (Gizzi and Mendon\u00e7a 2020, 237) .

The answers to the question \"In face of the Covid-19 pandemic, was there any kind of mobilization promoted by your community of faith towards the poor? If yes, what kinds of actions have been or are being taken?\" confirmed our hypothesis, demonstrating that, in fact, in the face of an emergency situation, the first and main mobilization addressed the basic needs of food, hygiene and health, and in some cases, bill payments and financial aid. These resources represent an immediate mobilization effort to alleviate the suffering of the less fortunate and those who were taken off-guard by unemployment or business interruptions and to ensure their survival during the crisis. However, these are solutions that cannot be sustained for long, especially since many of these actions were already being practiced during \"normal\" times, as some leaders reported: \"we were already helping the families that come to us every month and our community team is making lunches and serving meals every Sunday\" (Catholic priest, RJ). These services prioritize members of the community and their surroundings, as noted by the pastor of a Baptist church (SP): \"as the church itself is made up of poor and underprivileged people, our leadership initiated a collection campaign to donate substantial monthly food baskets both for much of the membership and also families in the community that the church serves.\" This report also shows that these actions were institutionally organized, and there was no mention of particular individual efforts by any of the leaders or members of their religious communities in the responses. Some responses demonstrated mobilization for psychological and spiritual issues: \"spiritually and emotionally, there was a need for guidance and counseling to alleviate the panic generated by the epidemic...\" (Baptist pastor, SP); \"yes, distribution of basic food baskets, raffles of gifts for families; emotional assistance for families through family prayer\" (Catholic leader, RR).",

            "text": "Religion acts continuously in the systematization of ethical conceptions for the conduct of life in society. Religious leaders or, in Weberian typology, \"priests,\" ensure the development of a rational system of religious thought according to which the order of nature and social relations occurs primarily as a creation of the gods (Weber 2015) . Observance of religious law emerges as a specific means for gaining the benevolence of the gods (Weber 2015, 298) . The relationship with the economy is not random. Since then, many studies have correlated religion and economics, demonstrating that religions embody a broad range of world views and life practices in which the relationships of exchange are intimately intertwined with a market economy, even if they are not necessarily made explicit as such. This point of view is defended by Stark and Iannaccone (1994) and called Rational Choice Theory. According to Rational Choice Theory, religious phenomena take place within a market dynamic in which religious institutions produce and sell religious goods to meet a consumer demand. In turn, consumers choose their religious affiliation, according to the religious goods that best favor their needs. It is therefore a religious economy. For Stark and Iannaccone (1994) , religious goods can be grouped into four types: (1) religious goods as compensators and other-worldly rewards; (2) religious goods as religious membership; (3) religious goods as collective goods; (4) religious goods as household commodities. Stolz (2006) argues for the integration of the concepts of Rational Choice with the classic views of Max Weber, recovering from them the notions of institutionalized ends for salvation and the means for salvation, as well as the idea of religious goods as a means of religious authority (Stolz 2006, 13). 4 In this regard, piety, care for the poor, and assistance to the needy take on a primary role in the discourses of leaders of local Christian communities, who guide believers in terms of the motivations and actions appropriate to the religious system.",

Considering the possible difficulty in evaluating real motivations through the use of digital interview tools, we decided to formulate an open question allowing religious leaders to add an additional reason for the mobilization carried out by their communities: \"is there another reason that drives (or should drive) the faithful of your community to act in relation to poverty?\" In this case, there were 13 \"no\" responses (15.6% of the total) and 3 responses that diverged from the theme of motivations. The other answers were also able to be evaluated by the same Weberian typology: 7 answers (8.4%) referred to rational motivations in terms of ends, such as, for example: \"very low income leads young people to drugs, crime and urban violence. These risks diminish when children are protected\" (Anglican pastor, PE); \"to manifest the values of the Kingdom of God in the community as a testimonial\" (Baptist pastor, SP); \"yes, to fight and demand that the constituted powers do what they must! (Catholic priest, RR). In 18 cases (21.6%), the answers emphasized the traditional manner: \"acting in obedience to Christ, showing empathy and mercy\" (Presbyterian pastor, MG); \"fulfilling Christ's commandment to Source: Elaborated by the author from the data collected in the research love one's neighbor\" (Other denomination pastor, SP); \"yes, living the commandment of love\" (Catholic priest, SP). In 25 responses (30.1%), the rational sense in terms of values was emphasized, for example: \"awareness of the situation facing the country/ community\" (Anglican leader, SP); \"solidarity during this pandemic\" (Catholic priest, SP); \"the dignity of each human being\" (Catholic priest, SP); \"social commitment\" (Presbyterian pastor, SP). The affective sense was emphasized in 17 responses (20.4%): \"pity\" (Baptist leader, SP); \"being more hospitable to the most neediest! (Anglican priest, RJ); \"love of one's neighbor, sharing with those who have less\" (Catholic priest, RR); \"helping others because the church is in a needy area\" (Baptist pastor, SP). Again, in the answers to the open questions, the least indicated motivation was in the rational sense regarding ends. In this case, there was a greater indication of rational actions in terms of values, placing the principles of religion as preponderant for mobilizations in the face of the pandemic. Actions based on the traditional mode and affective mode were largely balanced, reinforcing the tendency demonstrated in question 6. We thus observe that action in an affective sense, represented by the phrase \"showing compassion/love for the least favored,\" and action in a traditional manner, represented by \"obeying the values of the Gospel,\" reflect two aspects of the current moment in the Brazilian religious field. The first aspect is peculiar to the pandemic. It would be expected that the commotion caused by images abundantly disseminated by the media of patients in ICUs or coffins in mass graves would motivate the population independently of the professed religion. The second aspect, which affirms the search for an alignment with the commandments, rules, and obedience to norms established by religion, confirms studies that show a tendency towards conservatism-or, as some prefer to say, neo-conservatism, which advocates religion moving into the political sphere in order to restore the \"lost order\" in the social world. According to Peter Berger, religion lends legitimacy to institutions, placing them in a sacred and cosmic frame of reference (Berger 1985, 46) . Thus, when Christian leaders claim \"only by being Christian\" as their main motivation to mobilize their communities or \"fulfillment of the commandments,\" the \"imperative to go into the world,\" \"to act in obedience to Christ,\" and \"to live the commandment of love,\" they are lending divine authority to an institutional discourse.",

It was perceived that the leaders are aware of the economic inequality in the structures of society and expound a critical religious that reads the causes of inequality originating in the very structure of society, a view that is close to the opinion of Santos (2012) . In the discourse of these leaders, these structural causes are conjugated to human sin, which exists in the social structures, for example: \"In my opinion it is the result of the complex web that involves sin in the human heart, sin in a structural manner, which is selfishly manifested in the various logics that reaffirm the other as the object of my exploitation and enrichment in the name of these sins and malignant logics\" (Baptist pastor, SP); \"the structure of social organization based on privileges\" (Anglican leader, RS). Other opinions affirm that structural poverty has been historically built into society: \"social injustice and historical causes such as the consequences of slavery, colonization ...\" (Catholic priest, SP). Other analyses consider an economic point of view: \"poor income distribution in the country and an economic system that does not incorporate alternatives for social development\" (Anglican priest, RJ); \"reflection of capitalism, egoism\" (Presbyterian pastor, SP); \"social inequality, unequal income distribution\" (\"O Brasil para Cristo\" leader, SP). Comparing these responses with the previous answers about the concrete actions carried out by the communities of faith, we can see an urgent that needs to give immediate assistance in face of the emergency situation, but the fact that poverty is perceived as structural and enduring for a long time in Brazil demonstrates a tendency for institutions that traditionally serve people in poverty to be even more overburdened. The discouragement perceived in several responses demonstrates that religious institutions, which by their own nature already promote frequent actions to assist the populations of their communities, are already worn down by the confrontation with structural poverty and even more overburdened in the situation of the pandemic. In some of these responses, a feeling of powerlessness is insinuated in face of the enormity of the difficulties, such as \"today a few rich people have more wealth than the poorest 50%, the worst situation in the history of humanity\" (Presbyterian leader, PR); \"the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few, poor attention from governments and a lack of solidarity\" (Catholic priest, SP); \"the economic system is insensitive to this question\" (Baptist pastor, RJ).",

Internal individual causes were mentioned twice: \"accommodated\" (Baptist pastor, SP); \"in my opinion the fact that extreme poverty still exists is very much linked to existing corruption, the lack of compassion and liberality of people and also the lack of commitment by some to get out of the condition in which they find themselves\" (Baptist pastor, SP); \"huh?

The actions of the State and society in relation to each of these faces involve different behaviors depending on the specific situation; however, a pandemic requires emergency care and protection of the most vulnerable. For the Brazilian sociologist Milton Santos (2012), the last century revealed at least three faces of poverty. The first type was included poverty, caused by accidental, residual, and seasonal factors, generally understood as a natural or social accident. At that time, according to Santos, this type of poverty would have been located in a region, seen as a maladjustment between natural and social conditions, and the solution to it would also have been local, through private and welfare initiatives. Next was marginality poverty, which developed in tandem with the economic process and increased consumption, heralded by information systems that classify individuals according to their capacity to consume. Poverty acquired new content and definitions, given that new forms for the circulation of goods and dissemination of information provided the material and psychological conditions necessary for consumption to expand. Poverty was as such considered undesirable, and the poor were labeled \"marginals.\" The solution in this case would be the responsibility of the State, following the example of the Social Welfare State, but whose logic had a boomerang effect-that is, the formulas used to overcome poverty fed back into the system itself, perpetuating the very poverty they were meant to eradicate. At that time, in countries like Brazil, Santos says, \"the public power was forced to find formulas, ways out, the semblance of a solution. There was a certain shame in not facing the issue\" (Santos 2012, 71) . The third type of poverty, Santos argues, and which has developed until now, is globalized structural poverty. For this author, this type of poverty is the result of rational and deliberate actions:",

This author's criticism is that in such a situation, poverty becomes \"a necessary result of the present process, an inevitable phenomenon, even considered a natural fact\" (Santos 2012, 72) , and whose banalization is imposed and explained as something natural. Santos explains that the division of labor was until recently something more or less spontaneous, but that today \"it obeys scientific canonswhich is why we consider it a managed division of laborand is driven by a mechanism that brings with it the production of social debts and the spreading of poverty on a global scale\" (Santos 2012, 73) . This type of poverty combines the expansion of unemployment with a reduction in the value of work. The solutions to poverty in this case are relegated to the lower levels of government (municipalities and states), which seek compensatory policies to alleviate the consequences of poverty while federal governments and global companies and institutions act in the opposite direction, promoting actions that continue to generate more poverty. The actions of these companies and organizations promote social projects that attack the manifestations of poverty, financing palliative programs to attend to the poor while structurally these solutions do not promote a significant transformation of society. For Santos, a factor that aggravates the situation is globalization, \"often considered a fatality, based on an exaggerated enchantment with cuttingedge techniques and negligence in the social factor\" (Santos 2012, 75) . The poor persons of this third moment are no longer included or marginalized; in this condition, they become excluded.",

Asked whether their convictions about poverty had been confirmed, adjusted, or changed in the face of the pandemic, 65 of the 83 (78%) said they were confirmed, revealing a pessimistic-or at least not very optimistic-attitude towards the conditions under which the pandemic spread across the country. The tendency of the responses shows a certain discouragement in the face of the magnitude of the problem: \"well confirmed, it is regrettable how governments, especially the federal one, treat the poor. And I lament how the poor treat themselves and deliver their lot to unjust governments in this area\" (Presbyterian pastor, MG); \"confirmed, the poor are at the mercy of history. The pandemic has revealed the situation of misery in our country\" (Catholic priest, SP); \"I still cannot fully assess the impact of the pandemic on my convictions about poverty. In one respect, something in my convictions has been confirmed to some extent: poverty is not simply a result of the individual actions of the poor, but a complex phenomenon produced and reinforced by the unequal and exclusionary structure of society. This seems to be confirmed when we observe that those most affected by the pandemic, with their situation of poverty becoming further aggravated, are precisely those whom the social configuration itself excludes from full access to fundamental rights such as health, basic sanitation, education, etc.\" (Baptist leader, SP); \"yes they were confirmed, given the realization that there is indifference on the part of many to meet the fundamental needs of human beings\" (Catholic priest, SP); \"I am from the periphery, so my convictions have not changed, we are only more saddened because it is the layer of society that suffers the most\" (Baptist pastor, SP). The answers also reflect concerns about the economic consequences after the pandemic: \"they were confirmed, because for the economically less fortunate we see that the difficulties involving food, sustenance, health and awareness about prevention and care are much greater\" (Adventist pastor, SP); \"were confirmed from people inside and outside the community that lost their jobs or closed their small businesses, strengthening large merchants\" (Presbyterian pastor, SP).",

In Deuteronomy, the meaning was that there should be no poor among the Israelites, and that whenever this did occur, the instruction was that the situation should be generously resolved (not a palliative solution, but a definitive one): \"If there is among you a poor man of your brethren, within any of the gates in your land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother, 8 but you shall open your hand wide to him and willingly lend him sufficient for his need, whatever he needs.\" (Deut 15:7-8). In the case of the Gospels, however, Jesus' application of this passage from the Scriptures is interpreted by evangelists by classifying poverty as something which needs some kind of help in the face of a specific situation: For you have the poor with you always, but Me you do not have always. 12 For in pouring this fragrant oil on My body, she did it for My burial.",

In balancing these opposites, the biblical perspective encourages the people of God in missionary life to be a present symbol of justice and peace that characterizes the fullness of the coming Kingdom, by already producing [...] socially-relevant community development actions that cooperate to overcome scenarios of poverty, injustice and oppression\" (Baptist leader, SP); \"I understand that only with the coming of Jesus and the kingdom He will brings will there be full justice and equality.

Jesus' phrase is not determinism, it is a warning. Jesus desires the eradication of human indigence.

The most accurate understanding of this affirmation when observed in its sociopolitical context is not that of fatalism but rather the inevitability of the presence of the poor, thus calling for the individual and collective responsibility of Israel by taking as a parameter the past experience with slavery in Egypt (Arruda 2018, 85) . Brought to the gospels, this expression takes on a different meaning in Jesus' words. The episode is narrated in the four gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), with minor differences. Matthew places his narrative in the economic-financial realm, citing the complaints uttered by the disciples when a woman pours perfume on Jesus' head: \"When the disciples saw this, they were outraged and asked: 'Why this waste? This perfume could be sold at a high price, and the money given to the poor'\" (Matthew 26:8-9, NKJBV). However, Jesus' re-reading takes poverty out of the economic context, when he characterizes the woman's attitude as a \"good deed,\" even if it implies a waste of money. On the other hand, it is not only the financially poor who may be the target of a good action, but anyone who needs attention, like Jesus at that special moment in the face of the eminence of his death.",

This inequality, on the other hand, reverts to the benefit of all, both society and individuals; because social life requires a highly varied organism and very diverse functions, and what leads men to share these functions is, above all, the difference in their respective conditions. (RN, 9) In Leo XIII's view, the main problem is not inequality but enmity between the classes, and the role of institutions (State and Church) should be to resolve the conflict so that rich and poor are united in harmony and concord, each fulfilling their mutual duties-that is, the poor should continue to be poor, and the rich should continue to be rich (RN 9). In the opinion of Souza (2007) , this attitude reveals that the clergy was radically unaware of the economic factors of that historical moment, arguing pragmatically that the poor should be \"content with their luck and satisfied with their work,\" as stated in the Encyclical Auspicato Concessum, (1882), a posture that intended to appease the question between rich and poor and to stifle revolutions.",

Social inequality was seen as a natural and even providential fact. The clergy's radical ignorance of the economic factors that cause the misery of workers was impressive. They arrived at the absurdity of defending the idea that the existence of the poor is a social necessity that benefits the salvation of the rich. The poor were invariably asked for resignation and submission to the will of God, accepting their fate in its entirety. (Souza 2007, 42) Over the course of the twentieth century, however, this deterministic stance of Catholicism shifted radically to a perception that the Church should be a Church \"for\" the poor, and a new vision of the Church's mission emerged in which the irruption of the poor was seen in a positive light (Comblin 1996) . From the 1960s onwards, two encyclicals issued by Pope John XXIII brought a new approach to poverty: Mater et Magistra (1961) denounced the causes of impoverishment through economic and unjust relations, and Pacem in Terris (1963) placed poverty within the sphere of human rights (Arruda 2018, 53) .",

The solution to poverty, in this case, would be a consequence of the salvation of the soul, and Protestantism bet on technological development as a strategy not only to evangelize but to also solve social problems only for individuals and not the collectivity, much less in terms of structures (Arruda 2018, 55) .",

Souza (2020) draws a parallel between the current situation and the occasion when a plague hit the city of Wittenberg during the time of Luther. According to this author, two principles stand out in the letter that Luther wrote in response to the epidemic: \"the sanctity of life, including one's own life, and the sanctity of one's neighbor, particularly when sick and in need. For Luther, we need to take care of our own body, avoiding being infected by the disease as much as possible. In this sense he advocated measures such as quarantines and medical treatment. On the other hand, if any Christian thought he should leave the city to protect himself from the disease, he recognized that this was a personal decision and should not arouse guilt, but should be taken before God, in prayer, always considering the need of his neighbor\" (Souza 2020). The theologian Paul Freston (2020) draws a parallel with Father Antonio Vieira (seventeenth century) in emphasizing the duty of the government and churches during times of crisis. According to Freston, the rational and sensitive must work together along the two dimensions that characterize the current crisis: health, which requires rational action, and the economic impact, which requires \"sensitive respect.\" In this regard, he highlights the actions of evangelical ecclesiastical leaders who claim privileges in relation to the closure of churches, an attitude that can put at risk the very faithful in their religious communities as well as other citizens. Freston's critique (2020) predicts that after the coronavirus crisis has subsided, \"there will be formal and informal inquiries about what happened. And the judgments will not be complacent regarding those forms of religion that have been self-centered, selfabsorbed, incapable of examining events from a broader perspective. Selfishness during times of crisis will not be easily forgotten\" (Freston 2020) . Some Christian theologians have also defended a fatalistic view of the crisis, interpreted as punishment from a sovereign God who had sent or allowed the virus to spread throughout the world according to His purpose: a call to repentance and instrument for salvation (Piper 2020).",

Poverty was understood as unjust, undesirable and to be fought, never accepted as fatality, and much less as necessary to the social order. An ambivalence could be seen between discourse and praxis: while the socio-political structure was pointed out as the main factor generating poverty, the actions in relation to poverty were punctual and assistential, aiming to meet the urgency of the pandemic, without considering the possibility of mobilization directed at the public instances denounced in the responses. The discourse was weakened, intimidated by the socio-political reality. Asked to provide a religious interpretation of poverty from the biblical text, the leaders had responses that tended to rationalization and ambivalence: on the one hand, the conformism of the present reality and on the other the defense of an active posture of assistance to the impoverished population, with a slight tendency to value the defense of the religious tradition as motivation for action in relation to the poor during the pandemic.",

At certain times, Christianity has seen poverty as fatalistic, inevitable, and even necessary for the balance of the social order. In our study, guided by the analysis of Santos (2012) , poverty in the current socio-economic context has an equally fatalistic character, but with a completely different origin and purpose than in the original Christian conception. While for Santos, poverty is a rational and deliberate product of the globalization process, in Christianity, poverty is the expression of human injustice. Our research shows that the conception of poverty by the Christian leaders consulted is impregnated by the current cosmovision of the functioning of a system that continuously generates structural poverty as an inevitable and immutable reality. Nevertheless, it is opposed to the fatalistic stance that considers poverty desirable in order to maintain the social order, revealing resistance on the part of the leaders to the maintenance of poverty and the undertaking of extensive practical social assistance actions during the pandemic period, even though no efforts towards a broader mobilization that could bring about structural changes in Brazilian society were identified. Following the Weberian typology, we realized that, in order to mobilize the faithful of their religious communities, the leaders employed motivations that involve traditional action (obedience to the principles of religion) and affective action (driven by sensitivity to the suffering generated by the current crisis). They also described motivations for rational action based on values, in which the principles of equality, justice, and solidarity stand out as a guide for the faithful of their churches.",
