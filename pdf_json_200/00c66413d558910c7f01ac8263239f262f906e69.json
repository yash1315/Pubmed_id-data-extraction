We determined the prevalence and type of a wide variety of respiratory pathogens in 12,075 United States subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in March and April 2020. Infections with other respiratory pathogens, which on their own produce at least some SARS-CoV-2 symptoms including mortality, were present in both SARS-CoV-2 + and SARS-CoV-2-subjects. Non-SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 + (86%) patients than SARS-CoV-2-patients (76%) (p < 0.0001). Among the co-pathogens present in both subject groups were K. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis which can produce serious respiratory illness on their own, Advanced age and nursing home status were associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 + and coinfection rates. Testing for the presence of co-pathogens going forward will assist in the diagnosis and optimal treatment of suspected SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in the current pandemic.",

An estimated 5 to 80% of infected individuals are asymptomatic, while 3 to 4% will die despite current approaches to treatment (Nishiura et al., 2020) . These symptoms are also present in other, sometimes fatal respiratory infections, e.g., K. pneumonia, and M. catarrhalis (Cox et al., 2020) . Patients with primary SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory infections may have increased susceptibility to a secondary respiratory infection, with the probable result of exacerbations of disease severity should both be present (Cox et al., 2020) . It is likely that co-infection with some pathogens will lead to greater severity of illness and complicate treatments which address only SARS-CoV-2 or the co-pathogen (Cox et al., 2020) . There is limited information about respiratory co-infection in SARS-CoV-2 subjects.",

The study tested for Influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, other coronaviruses, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses. Bacterial pathogens were not tested in this study. The most common detected pathogen in SARS-CoV-2-patients was rhinovirus (5.93%), whereas in SARS-CoV-2 + patients the most common co-pathogen were non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviridae viruses (Nowak et al., 2020) . Of note, only 13.4% of the 1,204 SARS-CoV-2 + and 11.4% of the 7,418 SARS-CoV-2-patients were tested for co-pathogens. The basis for sample selection was not disclosed and may not be representative of the population at risk.",

This may be due to increased risk of pneumonia, the primary cause of SARS-CoV-2 deaths in coinfected individuals (Gao et al., 2020) . The fatal pneumonia cases may result from an excessive immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2 called \"cytokine storm, \" elicited by the response to multiple pathogens (Zhou et al., 2020) . The extent to which one type of infection affects the susceptibility to the other in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Respiratory co-infections were reported to be major contributors to morbidity and mortality in previous viral respiratory epidemics, such as the influenza pandemics of 1918 and 2009 (Morens et al., 2008; MacIntyre et al., 2018) .

Previous studies have shown that respiratory viral infections predispose patients to bacterial infection with a more severe clinical course with greater morbidity and mortality (Prasso and Deng, 2017) . Post-viral bacterial pneumonia produces complex interactions between the bacteria and viruses, normal nasopharyngeal bacterial flora, and the host immune system (Lee et al., 2016) . For example, viral infection can damage the respiratory epithelium, enabling infiltration and infection by bacterial flora and subsequent pneumonia, and can also upregulate bacterial binding sites, facilitating infection (Lee et al., 2016) . Additionally, viral infection can impair activity of monophages, a key participant in immune function (Lee et al., 2016) . A characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infections is significantly reduced lymphocyte counts (Li et al., 2020) . Lymphocytes are essential for adaptive immunity. The very high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in SARS-CoV-2 \"cytokine storm, \" can cause lymphocyte apoptosis and resultant lymphocytopenia (Jensen et al., 2018) . This lymphocytopenia constitutes an immunodeficient state, which could make these patients more susceptible to coinfection with other pathogens (Li et al., 2020) .",

The infection rate for these other respiratory pathogens throughout the United States is much greater than that of SARS-CoV-2 itself in subjects seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing. Infection with these other respiratory pathogens as well as co-occurrence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was increased in the elderly and those who reside in nursing homes. Gender and race did not impact rates of infection with other respiratory pathogens. These results suggest that patients with pre-existing respiratory infections are at increased risk to develop a SARS-CoV-2 infection, or conversely, that once infected with SARS-CoV-2, vulnerability to other respiratory pathogens is increased. Identifying and treating other respiratory pathogens along with SARS-CoV-2 testing should facilitate better outcomes in the current pandemic.",
