            "text": "We are overwhelmed by scientific publications on clinical observations, virology and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections. There is a growing body of evidence that hypercoagulability complicates COVID-19, probably contributing to poor prognosis. This should stimulate further research into the pathogenesis of this procoagulant type of DIC, and therapeutic options [1]. Viral infections may have different effects on the coagulation system. While e.g. Marburg Virus causes a severe bleeding phenotype, in COVID-19 particularly hypercoagulability with elevated D-dimer concentration and strong involvement of endothelium, vessels and solid organs are evident. A higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 is associated with Blood group A, which is connected with increased von Willebrand factor [2], possibly enhancing hypercoagulability. This kind of disorder has been denoted as thromboinflammation [3] , with thrombin as a central pathophysiological player. In this scenario, the complex pathophysiology with interactions of body\u00b4s innate immune response with different connected systems such as coagulation, fibrinolysis, Kallikrein-Kinin system, Complement, and other mediators of immunity (particularly cytokine storm) are not fully understood. It is important to consider that a critical balance between (proteolytic) activation and natural inhibitor mechanisms normally regulates these systems and their interactions. For instance, in the coagulation system, natural inhibitors like Antithrombin III (AT III), Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) and the Thrombomodulin/Protein C (PC) system should control activators like tissue factor and thrombin [1].",

We would like to propose that we should take advantage of the fact that inhibitors can act in a cooperative way in order to counteract an overshooting activation of defence systems. If this is true, the patients would not need further activators e.g. fibrinolytics, rather native proteins and inhibitors, such as AT III, PC, and may be even \u03b12-M. There is an important difference to inherited coagulation defects like haemophilia, where very low levels FVIII are sufficient to prevent spontaneous bleeding. Covid-19 like ARDS is a dynamic process with high turnover and critical importance of the above mentioned native proteins, where lower normal levels might be not sufficient. Having in mind the significance of any progress in treating COVID-19, but also the old, huge and still unresolved problem of treating inflammatory DIC e.g. in sepsis and ARDS, killing much more people than COVID-19 so far did, further research is urgently warranted.",

Whereas the attack rate in children appears to correspond to that in adults, it is obvious that children are less frequently diagnosed having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms, or both [6] . The reasons for the relative resistance of children remain obscure. It was suggested that maturational changes, more active innate immune response, or differences in the distribution, maturation, and functioning of viral receptors may play a role [6] . Immune responses in adults are generally slower, less coordinated, and less efficient, making adults and particularly the elderly more susceptible to all infectious agents, due to a process denoted as immunosenescence.",

The endothelial lesion in COVID-19 may thus culminate in a final, destructive phase of inflammation, sending a divers army of cells and cytokines to fight invaders and mop up the debris of battle [2] . It might be reasonable to assume that children are more likely to possess \"healthier\" immune response and endothelial cells than adults, particularly than elderly with hypertension, diabetes or vascular diseases. However, is this already the whole story about children's' obviously more favourable course of COVID-19? We think, in order to understand this advantage, we have to explore more closely the complex interactions of the general host defence systems, particularly those against bleeding or thrombosis and pathogen invasion, since thrombin as key activator of blood coagulation, platelets and endothelial cells may have profound impact on innate immunity].",

It is well known that the first thrombotic manifestation in hereditary AT III deficiency occur usually not before the third decade of life, suggesting that there are protective mechanism in place for the young. In adult patients with ATIII deficiency, \u03b12-M levels are high [30], however, the evaluation of families did not include enough younger patients for evaluation.
