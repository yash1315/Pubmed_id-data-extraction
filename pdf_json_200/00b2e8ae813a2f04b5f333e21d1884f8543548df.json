Most of the academic sector started unified learning, still most of them struct with old steps. The unexpected Plague of a deadly infection called COVID-19 caused by (SARS-Cov-2) trembled the whole world. The WHO announced it as a disease outbreak. This circumstance challenged the whole education system worldwide and compelled educators to change to an online mode immediately. Many educational organizations that were earlier unwilling to change their traditional didactic practice had no choice but to move exclusively to online teaching-learning. This article provides an elaborate discussion about the education sector's impact during a disease outbreak in India. It offers a detailed discussion regarding how India adopts the e-learning approach in this critical situation. Further, it describes how to cope with the challenges related to e-learning.",

Moreover, aged people and those affected by severe disorders in health conditions like cancer, chronic respiratory disorder, and diabetes are more likely to develop severe illness and death. The first case of COVID -19 in India originated from China and was registered on Jan 30, 2020. Currently, India has an enormous number of cases in Asia (Kumar et al. 2020a, b) . The transmission mode from human to human-generated is required for social distancing and avoidance in crowded locations (Venkatasen et al. 2020) . In this context, Most governments have closed the schools and institutions, where people cannot be prevented until further notification (UNESCO 2020). As of Sep 20, 2020, nearly 1.077 billion learners are affected due to the school's closure in response to the Outbreak.",

Hence, the traditional method (Face to Face teaching) has been replaced by E-learning for the time being. In contrast, the developed countries to developing countries observed that developing countries face difficulties like week internet connectivity, improper knowledge of ICT (Information and communications technology) usage, and weakness of content growth (Aung and Khaing 2015) . For example, the accessibility of content like video and other applications is still new to many teachers in developed nations, even at the university level. This new trend allows for technological improvements, and educators shift their culture in the organization. The critical factor to be considered before applying e-learning is that either learners are ready and will achieve in an online platform (Guglielmino and Guglielmino 2003; Watkins et al. 2004) . Although learners can show success in traditional methods and classrooms, that is not enough to accomplish that goal in an online learning circumstance (Watkins et al. 2004 ).",

It has a common ability to utilize a computer associated with a network that allows it anytime and anywhere (Cojocariu et al. 2014) . Online learning is a tool that can produce the teaching-learning process more In-class quiz and homework student-centered, innovative, and flexible. Online learning is defined as ''learning experiences in both synchronous and asynchronous platforms by different devices (e.g., mobile, laptops, and phone) with internet access. In this platform, students can be independent to study and interact with teachers and other students (Singh and Thurman 2019) . The synchronous learning platform is structured because students attend live lectures and real-time communication among teachers and students. It has the possibility of instant feedback, whereas asynchronous learning platforms are not properly structured. Learning content is not presented in live classes; it is presented at different learning systems and mediums. Immediate feedback and instant response are not possible under such a platform (Littlefield 2018) . Synchronous learning offers many opportunities for social communication (McBrien et al. 2009 ). Among this deadly virus transmitted, such virtual platforms are required (1) video conferencing with a minimum of 40 to 50 students is possible, (2) conversation with a student can perform to keep classes organic, (3) internet connections are good, (4) lectures are handy in mobile phones also and not just laptops, (5) opportunity of watching already recorded and stored lectures and (6) Immediate feedback from students can attain and assignments can be taken (Barboni 2019).",

India has the world's largest population that offers substantial opportunities in the education industry. Schools, colleges, and institutions are using online teaching as the primary mode of classes. The teachers and instructor steadily organize online webinars and meetings. The requirement for online teaching and learning has shown a massive explosion since the closure. It represents an enormous demand that is rising for online learning. Online teaching has been widely used in many countries as their dominant mode of education. The online teaching method needs only reliable internet connectivity and a laptop or smartphones as necessary. Also, students do not have to move from one place to another, so the traveling time is minimal. The retaining capacity is also strengthened because of travel; the student wouldn't feel depressed. Learning from home always offers a pleasant place to focus, as students can determine the best environment for themselves. The significance of virtual learning is rising, as the academic year has been radically disrupted due to COVID-19. Online teaching brings a lot to the learning table for all students because they are from pre-school or graduate level. Numerous digital tech companies have played a significant role in the change like google classroom, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Blackboard (Adeoye et al. 2020) .

The institutions used personal platforms like Moodle to transmit education content to expand communication among students and professors.

Likewise, companies have adjusted to shifting their regular activities to digital workplaces and are performing globally.COVID-19 has also effect the internship season. Mid-April -July is traditionally called an internship season. Still, now most students pursue summer internships, and employees hire the highest number of interns compared to the previous year. As a side impact of the disease outbreak, some firms had to either cancel or postpone the summer internship programs. The COVID-19 gave birth to the ambiguity about internships for thousands of students all around India. Some of them lost their internship opportunities, whereas others have chosen to seek internships during summer break. To support individual students overcome this ambiguity and help them manage their internship circumstance, we have created a list of internship employing trends that arose during a disease outbreak.",

The most effective content would efficiently compete with the student's requirements, resulting in positive user engagement and an optimum outcome.
