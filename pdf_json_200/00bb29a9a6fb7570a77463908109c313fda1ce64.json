The pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, is a novel \u03b2-coronavirus, and transmitted mainly through droplets and close contact. It is highly contagious and can spread quickly such that the entire human population is susceptible. Patients often present respiratory symptoms and fever 5-6 days after being infected with the virus (the latency period ranging 1-14 days). Most cases develop into mild infection that can self-heal but severe cases often lead to death, especially in elders. 1 In one study, among the 44,672 diagnosed cases, 87% were adults from 30 to 79 years of age, whereas the incidence in children and teenagers of 10-19 years was generally low (~1%). 2 SARS-CoV2 can complex with other pathogens, among which 8.6% were mycoplasma. 3 Pleural effusion is seldom seen in COVID-19. 4.5 In this case report, we present a 12-year-old boy who contracted COVID-19 accompanied with mycoplasma infection and secondary pleural effusion.",

Since February 4, the boy experienced recurrent fever without apparent causes. His maximum temperature was 38\u00b0C without chills, convulsions or vomiting. His body temperature occasionally dropped to normal without treatment. Routine blood examination in local hospitals was normal, with C-reactive protein level at 27.53 mg/L. The chest computed tomography (CT) showed ground-glass opacities in the right upper lung (Fig. 1A, C) . After using Mezlocillin, the child had defervescence. On the evening of February 11, he suffered fever again with body temperature of 37.6\u00b0C. On February 13, the child had paroxysmal colic in the right lower abdomen at night without apparent causes, which became aggravated after exercise. He had no diarrhea and his stools were normal. He also had fever and night sweat with a maximum temperature of 38\u00b0C. Local hospital considered acute appendicitis. His colic pain was relieved following a symptomatic treatment. On February 19, the child developed nocturnal cough with sputum difficult to cough out. He also had fever with the maximum temperature of 37.4\u00b0C, and had no thoracalgia or oppression in chest. Local hospital's laboratory showed hemoglobin concentration 116 g/L, platelet 339 \u00d7 10 9 /L, leucocyte count 7.09 \u00d7 10 9 /L (neutrophils 51.6%, lymphocyte 32.9% and monocyte 8.4%), eosinophil count 0.49 \u00d7 10 9 /L and C-reactive protein 40.163 mg/L. Mid-turbinate swabs were negative for influenza virus A and influenza virus B. Mycoplasma IgM and chlamydia IgM were also negative from blood examination. Chest CT revealed moderate effusion in the right pleural cavity (Fig. 1B, D) . After an outpatient evaluation, he was admitted to our hospital for further treatment on February 20.",

In addition, some children may manifest weakness, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. 6 Most cases present with mild or moderate fever, and some cases may even not have fever. In our case, the boy's main symptoms were recurrent fever with temperature from 37.4 to 38.0\u00b0C. He presented with nonproductive cough after 16 days of developing fevers. During this time, he suffered severe abdominal pain which is generally rare in the clinic. Late though his respiratory symptom appeared, and CT suggested pulmonary pathology 15 days earlier before he started coughing. This case study validated the importance of CT imaging in the diagnosis of COVID-19. In the early stage of disease, CT results indicated viral pneumonia in the right upper lung, which developed, 16 days later, into ground-glass opacities on both sides of the lung with pleural effusion. Despite significant CT changes, the child's clinic manifestations were overall mild with minor hyphemia and normal WBC count.

Most cases have C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation increased or normal, procalcitonin can be normal. In severe cases, D-dimer levels can be increased with lymphocyte count decreased. Inflammatory cytokine may increase in critical and severe cases. Some critical cases present troponin increased.",

Some child may only have positive of SRAS-COV-2 by PCR), and common type (imageology revealed pneumonia) symptoms such as fever and respiratory tract were common. While some children had no clinical symptoms with imageology changes were subclinical type), severe type (patients suffered from anoxia such as dyspnea and had oxygen saturation \u2264 0.92%), critical type (present to acute respiratory distress syndrome or respiratory failure or shock, with multiple organ dysfunction that may endanger life). 5, 6 Although the level of D-dimer in this case increased and coagulation function was abnormal, it did not meet the standard of severe pneumonia in children and should be attributed to common type. This child has been suffering from intermittent fever since the onset of the disease. On February 19, CT reported viral pneumonia in the right upper lung and present pleural effusion. Except for weak positive of mycoplasma and chlamydia, the examination of other pathogens including SARS-COV-2 was negative. COVID-19 was not confirmed until throat swabs PCR was made twice. Therefore, with the low sensitivity of SARS-COV-2 PCR examination, if there were respiratory symptoms and related epidemic history, do not exclude SARS-COV-2 infection easily, medical staff should still make strict relevant protection. As mycoplasma pneumonia IgM and IgG were weekly positive, we consider the mycoplasma infection as early stage. Hence, mycoplasma pneumonia was secondary. About 4%-20% of Mycoplasma pneumoniae complicated with pleural effusion, most of them were minor. 7, 8 The hydrothorax in this case was moderate. Because mycoplasma was newly infected and at early stage, we attribute the pleural effusion to COVID-19. Because pleural effusion content has never been studied in the COVID-19 infected children, we here for the first time in the world reported the hydrothorax cytology images as mature lymphocytes predominate. Besides, further investigation of the viral load in the pleural effusion is in need.",
