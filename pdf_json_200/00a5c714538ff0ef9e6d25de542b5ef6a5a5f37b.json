            "text": "Compared to other nuts, a serving of almonds provides the highest or among the highest amounts of fiber, protein, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, magnesium, calcium, iron, folate, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin E, phytosterols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids, and are among the lowest in calories, available carbohydrates, and saturated fat [1, 2] . An analysis of the United Kingdom's National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2008-2017 showed that whole almond consumers' diets had a higher nutrient quality score than non-consumers based on their higher intakes of protein, unsaturated fats, fiber, folate, vitamin E, and magnesium, and lower intakes of total carbohydrates, sugar, and sodium [3] . Additionally, the almond consumers had a lower mean body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) than non-consumers because when almonds are consumed, they stimulate a series of weight control mechanisms [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Meta-analyses of prospective studies have observed that frequent nut intake (\u226528 g/day) was associated with lower weight gain and risk of being overweight or obese compared to nut-free diets [11] [12] [13] . In Table 1 . Stratified overall mean change in anthropometric measures for nuts with and without dietary substitution guidance [23] . Li et al. [24] , in a 2018 meta-analysis (62 RCTs, 7184 individuals), evaluated the mean differences between specific nut and control diets on body mass (weight), BMI, and WC. Almonds were the only nut that significantly lowered mean body mass by \u22120.56 kg based on 20 RCTs compared to an overall mean body mass loss of \u22120.22 kg (Figure 1 ) for all nuts studied, where almonds accounted for 48% of the overall nut body mass loss effect. In addition, almond diets lowered mean BMI by \u22120.49 kg/m 2 and waist circumference (WC) by \u22122.4 cm compared to a lowered overall mean nut BMI by \u22120.16 kg/m 2 and WC by \u22120.51 cm, where almonds accounted for 34% and 29% of this overall mean nut effect size. There was a relatively high heterogeneity between the different types of nuts on body mass, BMI, and WC. The investigators believed that this heterogeneity and the low number of RCTs for some nuts made the pooled estimates too limited to conduct a complete stratified analysis by nut subtype, and the meta-analysis had geographical limitations as most of the RCTs were from North America or Europe. In 2020, almonds, walnuts, and pistachios each had an independent meta-analysis published with important updated insights on the effects of these nuts on changes in body mass, fat mass or %, BMI, and WC compared to control diets [25] [26] [27] . A comparison of the findings of body and fat mass between these nuts are summarized in Figure 2A and comparison findings on BMI and WC between these nuts are summarized in Figure 2B . Only the intake of almonds significantly decreased both body and fat mass, and the effects of these nuts on BMI and WC were variable.",

The researchers concluded that \"a diet with pistachios reduced BMI and had no significant effects on body weight or WC\".",

Compared to the control diet, the almond diet did not statistically or clinically alter body mass, with an overall gain of + 0.4 kg compared to the predicted body fat mass gain of 6.4 kg based on the added almond calories (almonds provided an average of 57,500 kcals for subjects during this study). A sub-group analysis showed that almond effects on body mass varied by sex and BMI: women were better able to maintain baseline body mass than men, and baseline lower or medium tertile BMI subjects gained body mass and higher BMI individuals (>28 BMI) actually lowered their body mass to varying levels. however, according to the investigators, all the body mass changes were relatively small and probably not biologically significant. Dietary analyses from food recalls showed that 54% of the extra almond energy was displaced by reduced intake of other foods, and food diaries showed 78% displacement. Jaceldo-Siegl et al. [30] showed that the addition of almonds to the habitual diet made for a healthier and more weight-controlled diet by significantly increasing levels of unsaturated fat, protein, fiber, magnesium, and alpha-tocopherol, and decreasing level of trans-fat, animal protein, cholesterol, sodium, and sugar.",

[44] , in a parallel RCT, randomized 73 healthy college freshman students (mean age 18 years, 58% women, mean BMI 26) to their usual diet plus snacking on roasted almonds (57 g/day; 364 kcal) or Graham crackers (78 g/day; 338 kcal/day). Anthropometric and appetite changes were determined from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks for almond and Graham cracker snacks. Both snacks significantly increased body mass and fatfree mass from baseline to 8 weeks (p < 0.05). Total body mass, trunk mass, trunk fat-free mass, and WC were not significantly different between baseline and week 8. For both snacks, mean 24 h hunger, desire to eat, and prospective consumption ratings significantly decreased from baseline to 4 weeks, with no difference after 8 weeks except for an increase in prospective consumption ratings. The 24 h fullness ratings did not significantly differ over the 8-week trial.",

Those in the almond group lost slightly but significantly less body mass than did those in the nut-free group at 6 months, but there were no differences at 18 months. The loss in fat mass for the nut-free group was nearly statistically significant at 6 months, but no significant differences in changes in fat mass were found between the groups at 18 months.

Additionally, the complier analysis showed a significant decrease in percentage of total and trunk fat mass, and a significant increase in percentage of truncal and total fat-free mass in the almond-enriched diet vs. the control diet (p < 0.05).

Significant effects on blood pressure (BP) and hs c-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were not identified. Musa-Veloso et al. [69] , in a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 RCTs with 27 datasets, evaluated the effects of almond-enriched diets on blood lipids in trials with a duration of \u22654 weeks. The mean main effect differences between almond and control diets on blood lipids levels showed that almonds significantly lowered TC, LDL-C, and TG, as summarized in Figure 16 . The effect of almond serving size on blood lipids showed that intakes of \u226545 g almonds/day were significantly more effective in lowering TC and LDL-C than doses of <45 g/day, and neither dosage significantly changed HDL-C or TG levels, as summarized in Figure 17 . Additionally, almonds were significantly more effective at lowering TC and LDL-C in individuals with elevated baseline lipid levels than those with normal healthy lipid levels. Lee-Bravatti et al. [28] , in a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis, evaluated 15 RCTs (n = 534 healthy or at risk for CVD subjects) for the overall mean changes in blood lipids, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure (BP) and hs C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) between almond and control interventions. Almond diets significantly lowered TC by \u221211 mg/dL and LDL-C by \u22126.0 mg/dL, with significant heterogeneity (p < 0.01 for both) based on 13 trials. Almonds lowered hDL-C by \u22121.3 mg/dL with no heterogeneity (p < 0.29) based on 12 trials. Almonds tended to lower TG by 16 mg/dL at doses >42.5 g/day and by 29 mg/dL after durations >6 weeks. Fasting blood glucose was slightly but significantly reduced at almond doses >42.5 g/day by \u22124.1 mg/dL (p < 0.01), which is consistent with greater almond intake associated with gut bulking, which helps slow the rate of glucose absorption. Diastolic blood pressure (BP) mean from 7 trials was insignificantly lowered by 1.5 mm hg, but there was a small reduction which was significant at almond dosages >42.5 g/day by \u22123.2 mm hg and durations >6 weeks by \u22124.2 mm hg (p < 0.01 for both). There were no significant changes in systolic BP at any almond dose or duration. The data on hs-CRP was too limited to run a subgroup analysis on. Figure 16 . Meta-analysis on mean changes in blood lipids between almond and control interventions (** p \u2264 0.001, * p = 0.042, + p = 0.207) [69] . Figure 17 .

Eslampour et al. [70] , in a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs (n = 16, 1128 subjects) on the effect of mean BP differences between almond and control interventions, confirmed the findings in Lee-Bravatti et al.

Mean diastolic BP for the almond diets was significantly lowered by \u22121.30 mm hg (\u22122.31, \u22120.30 mmHg; p = 0.01), with 0% heterogeneity. however, there was no significant lowering of mean systolic BP by \u22120.83 mm hg (\u22122.55, 0.89; p = 0.34), with 59% heterogeneity.",

Acute postprandial analysis for glycemic index or flow-mediated dilation shows limited impact on related longer time effects on glycemic, insulin, blood pressure, or endothelial health benefits.

The control muffin diet significantly raised TG by 10.8% \u00b1 4.7% from baseline, with no other significant changes in lipoproteins. Compared to baseline, almond diets reduced blood lipid concentrations in a dose-response manner ( Figure 29 ). Compared to the muffin control, both almond doses significantly reduced oxidized LDL-C from baseline and the full dose of almonds significantly reduced the estimated 10-year risk of CHD from baseline and control diet ( Figure 30 ). There was a 1% reduction of LDL-C for each 7 g intake of almonds. Ruisinger et al. [58] , in a parallel RCT, randomly assigned 48 hyperlipidemic subjects with ongoing statin therapy (50% women, mean age 60 years, mean BMI 29) into the NCEP Step 3 diet program with 100 g of almonds or a standard Step 3 diet program (control) for 4 weeks. Compared to the control Step 3 diet, the almond-enriched Step 3 diet significantly lowered non-HDL-C, very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL-C), intermediate density lipoproteins cholesterol (IDL-C), and tended to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, and lipoprotein (a) without significantly lowering hDL-C compared to the control diet (Table 5 ). There was also a shift from LDL pattern A to type B pattern particles in the almond group (p = 0.003). The investigators suggested that almonds may be used as adjunctive therapy with statins to further reduce CHD risk. Jenkins et al.

[101] provides insights that their increased absorption into circulation could have clinically important effects on reduced risk of weight gain or obesity, as follows: (1) decreased circulatory levels of acetate leads to slowed \"de novo\" hepatic synthesis of lipids and ghrelin associated with decreased fat storage and appetite, (2) increased circulatory propionate stimulates appetite hormones such as gLP-1 and Peptide YY released by L-entero-endocrine cells to reduce appetite and \"de novo\" synthesis of fatty acids in the liver associated with less fat storage, and (3) increased circulatory levels of butyrate are associated with the regulation of energy metabolism and increased leptin gene expression along with increased insulin sensitivity and anti-inflammatory activities. In conjunction with SCFA changes, the almond snack significantly lowered fecal pH to 7.0 pH (p = 0.03) compared to the biscuit snack, maintaining a pH of 7.4. The lower pH is generally a signal of a healthier colonic microbiota [92] . In addition, regular almond consumption increased the abundance of beneficial symbiotic ruminococci, in the colonic microbiota in individuals with elevated blood glucose. treatments maintained fecal pH at a healthy level of <6.5 throughout the trial. This study confirmed the prebiotic activity of almonds in younger adults. Dhillon et al. [98] , in a parallel RCT, randomly assigned 73 predominately breakfastskipping college freshmen (41 women and 32 men, age 18 years, mean BMI 25) to a diet isocalorically enriched with whole roasted almonds (57 g/day) or isocaloric Graham cracker snacks for 8 weeks. Almond snacking increased quantitative alpha-diversity Shannon index by 3% and Chao1 index by 8% compared to the cracker group after 8 weeks (p < 0.05). Additionally, almond snacking decreased the overall abundance of the pathogenic bacterium Bacteroides fragilis by 48% (p < 0.05). In the same cohort of subjects, glucose tolerance and postprandial insulin sensitivity were enhanced with the almond snack, suggesting that improved colonic microbiota and carbohydrate metabolism may be inter-related. Overall, this trial indicated that the consumption of almonds improved the diversity and composition of the colonic microbiota that appear to be linked to improved metabolic health markers.",

Poor diet and snacking quality are a major determinant of the risk of overweight, obesity, and poor health outcomes [106] . For example, in the US, among children ages 2 to 19 years, 41% are overweight and obese, with the rate of obesity progressively increasing to 71% among adults aged 20 years and older [106] . When almonds are consumed as snacks or with meals, they help to promote higher diet quality than non-almond consumers experience by providing higher intakes of protein, healthier unsaturated fatty acids, fiber, folate, vitamin E, and magnesium, and lower starch, sugar, and sodium, in part because they tend to displace other lower dietary quality foods to improve weight control [3] .",

Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of nut RCTs showed that almonds are the only nut that slightly but significantly lowers mean body and fat mass compared to control nut-free diets to help reduce the risk of being overweight or obese, even when multiple daily servings are consumed [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Additionally, almonds are also among the best nuts to improve BMI, WC, abdominal, truncal, and visceral fat [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] 42, 43, 53, 56, 62, 65] . Almond body mass and composition management mechanisms include: suppression of hunger and desire to eat sensations, compensation for added energy from almonds by reducing energy intake of other foods, increased fecal excretion of macronutrients, especially fat, leading to a lower net ED compared to the Atwater estimates, inhibition of de novo lipogenesis associated with better glycemic control, and higher resting energy expenditure [5] [6] [7] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] 102] . In addition, Cassady et al. [110] found that the number of times almonds are chewed can affect the body mass control mechanism, with 25 to 40 chews increasing fullness compared to 10 chews, and 10 chews increasing fecal energy excretion more than after 40 chews.",

RCTs and systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs are building the evidence that almonds are a healthy adjunctive dietary option for the prevention and management of CVD and T2 diabetes, which are leading global causes of pre-mature death and medical costs. Almonds consistently improve blood lipid profiles, including significant lowering TC, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, VLDL-C, Apo-B, and small LDL-C particles, and modest reductions in diastolic BP, which collectively translates into significant and clinically important reductions in the atherogenic index. however, almonds have inconsistent and/or insignificant beneficial effects on endothelial function, inflammatory markers, glycemic control, hbA1c, flow-mediated dilation, systolic BP, mean arterial pressure, or pulse pressure, which need to be studies in larger and longer-term trials. Several emerging RCTs suggest that almonds may play a role in improving working and visual memory and help to reduce facial wrinkle severity and width. Additionally, emerging data indicates that the intake of nuts such as almonds is associated with improved health status of older adults (e.g., longer telomere length and lower risk of sarcopenia) [116] .",

The US Food and Drug Administration approved a qualified health claim that eating 1.5 ounces (42.5 g)/day of tree nuts such as almonds as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of CHD [117] . A medical cost savings and quality of life analysis study in the US population using current US population CVD rates and the probabilities of elevated LDL-C increasing risk, disability, and death from CVD, found that increasing daily consumption of almonds up to 42.5 g/day could significantly reduce annual US CVD costs by about 25% and increase annual improvement in quality adjusted life years by 2% compared to <3 g almond/day average intake [118] . Other cost-benefit analyses show with high confidence that increased intake of foods such as almonds that lower glycemic index and glycemic load are causally correlated with reduced incidence of and medical costs related to T2 diabetes, which can reach 10% of the national health expenditures [119, 120] . It is estimated that 20% of these T2 diabetes healthcare costs are related to the addition to the diet of high glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) foods, which are reduced with almond intake, an essentially zero gI and gL food [1]. Although Becerra-Tomas et al. [121] , in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 observational studies, found no association between total nuts, tree nuts, or peanuts and risk of T2 diabetes. Jenkins et al. [112] , in an RCT, showed that nuts as a replacement for carbohydrates improves glycemic control, including lowering hbA1c, and reduces CVD risk by lowering the number of small LDL particles and levels of TC, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and Apo-B in individuals with T2 diabetes.",

The antioxidant activity of almonds has been best evaluated in two RCTs on habitual smokers, which showed some improvements of antioxidant biomarkers due to polyphenol compounds in the almond skins and suggested some antioxidant protection in smokers [124, 125] . A metaanalysis of 31 articles indicated that individuals with AD, age-related cognitive impairment, or mild cognitive decline had lower circulatory concentrations of \u03b1-tocopherol compared to healthy controls [126] . Additionally, an analysis of 115 deceased and autopsied cases in the Rush Memory and Aging Project showed that higher levels of brain tocopherols such as \u03b1-tocopherol were related to lower activated microglia density in the cortical brain, which might protect against AD to lower levels of inflammation, amyloid, and neurofibrillary tangle severity [127] .",

The colonic microbiota appears to play a major role in human metabolic health, and it is primarily controlled by the nutritional quality of the diet [128, 129] . Colonic microbiota can be modulated positively or negatively by different lifestyle and dietary factors and impact the risk of developing obesity, chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, CVD, and metabolic syndrome features), and infectious diseases. Moreover, microbial metabolites can induce epigenetic modifications (i.e., changes in DNA methylation and micro-RNA expression), with potential implications for health status and susceptibility to obesity. Microbial products, such as SCFAs, may affect metabolism by regulating appetite, lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, inflammation, and other functions. Intestinal dysbiosis can change the functioning of the intestinal barrier and the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) by allowing the passage of structural components of bacteria, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which activate inflammatory pathways that may contribute to the development of CVD, insulin resistance, and alter the production of gastrointestinal peptides related to satiety, food intake, and body fat metabolism. In addition, in CHD patients, a healthy colonic microbiota was shown to have anti-hyperuricemia effects by increasing uric acid excretion and regulating uric acid absorption by certain transporters, and the intake of 10 g/day of almonds soaked overnight and consumed before breakfast was shown to reduce serum uric acid by 18% over 12 weeks [130, 131] .",

This review also has some limitations, including: (1) most of the almond RCTs have a relatively small number of subjects and short duration, which may lead to excessive heterogeneity and mask some other metabolic outcomes in non-blood lipid biomarkers, and (2) this narrative review did not score the quality of each study or provide a quantitative, scientific synthesis of all RCTs into a statistical overall mean or analysis of subgroups, effect sizes, and heterogeneity, independently of what was provided by the specific RCTs reviewed.",

Additionally, since there is only one small RCT which evaluated young children and one RCT in college freshmen, it would be important to perform more studies on the effects of almonds on body mass and composition, and metabolic health biomarkers in toddlers through teenagers, because being overweight or obese and having poor metabolic health are growing health concerns in this age group. Additionally, it would be important to build on the facial wrinkle reduction research and expand research into other effects of almonds on healthy aging biomarkers.",

            "text": "Ukhanova et al. [95] , in a crossover, controlled-feeding RCT, fed 18 healthy adults (10 men and 8 women, mean age 56 years, mean BMI 27) whole raw almond daily doses of 0, 42, or 84 g for 18 days. The data were generally presented in a qualitative manner. Almond consumption led to a modest increase in microbiota bacteria beta-diversity, improved efficiency of fiber metabolism, and increased butyrate-producing bacteria. Each are potentially important signals of a healthy colonic microbiota.Holscher et al. [96] , in a crossover, controlled-feeding RCT, randomized 18 healthy adults (10 men and 8 women, mean age 57 years, mean BMI 30) into one of five diets: (1) 0 g control, or 42 g/day of the following almonds: (2) whole raw, (3) whole roasted, (4) roasted, chopped, and (5) almond butter for 18 days. Although almond intake did not significantly affect alpha or beta microbiota diversity, it did induce different changes compared to the control in the bacterial genera composition of the colonic microbiota depending on the degree of almond processing: (1) whole raw almonds increased Dialister (p = 0.007), (2) roasted whole almonds increased Lachnospira (p = 0.03), and (3) roasted, chopped almond consumption increased the relative abundances of Lachnospira, Roseburia, and Dialister (p \u2264 0.05). generally, these almond-related microbiota microflora are commensal bacteria known to produce short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, which can have positive effects on colonic health, immunity maintenance, and anti-inflammatory properties, but the health effects are not completely understood. Lastly, there were no differences in microbiota composition between almond butter and the almond-free control.Liu et al. [97] , in a parallel RCT, randomized 48 young adults (24 males and 24 women, age 18-24 years, mean BMI 20) into an average 2400 kcal diet enriched with: 56 g of whole roasted almonds, 10 g of almond skins, or 8 g of fructooligosaccharides (control), divided into two daily servings for 6 weeks. Whole roasted almonds and almond skins significantly increased fecal populations of symbiotic Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and decreased populations of the pathogen Clostridium perfringens. That was directionally similar to fructooligosaccharides, but there were no significant changes in E. coli in any diet ( Figure 39 ). After 6 weeks, almonds, almond skins, and fructooligosaccharides induced significantly reduced fecal nitro-reductases and beta-glucuronidase activity and increased fecal beta galactosidase activity, which are indicators of a healthy colonic microbiota. All treatments maintained fecal pH at a healthy level of <6.5 throughout the trial. This study confirmed the prebiotic activity of almonds in younger adults.Dhillon et al. [98] , in a parallel RCT, randomly assigned 73 predominately breakfastskipping college freshmen (41 women and 32 men, age 18 years, mean BMI 25) to a diet isocalorically enriched with whole roasted almonds (57 g/day) or isocaloric graham cracker snacks for 8 weeks. Almond snacking increased quantitative alpha-diversity Shannon index by 3% and Chao1 index by 8% compared to the cracker group after 8 weeks (p < 0.05). Additionally, almond snacking decreased the overall abundance of the pathogenic bacterium Bacteroides fragilis by 48% (p < 0.05). In the same cohort of subjects, glucose tolerance and postprandial insulin sensitivity were enhanced with the almond snack, suggesting that improved colonic microbiota and carbohydrate metabolism may be inter-related. Overall, this trial indicated that the consumption of almonds improved the diversity and composition of the colonic microbiota that appear to be linked to improved metabolic health markers.Ren et al. [59] , in a parallel RCT, randomly assigned 45 subjects with T2 diabetes (44% men, mean age 72 years, mean BMI 23) to one of two isocaloric diets: (1) an almondbased low-carbohydrate diet (56 g of almonds replacing 150 g of carbohydrate foods) or (2) a control low-fat diet (25% energy from fat) diet for 12 weeks with dietary counseling. Both diets significantly increased alpha diversity for Chao and PD index of the colonic microbiota compared to baseline (p < 0.05), which could promote long-term function resilience to metabolic stressors. The almond-based low-carbohydrate diet significantly increased the relative abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria Roseburia (p < 0.05), Ruminococcus (p < 0.05), and Eubacterium (p < 0.01).",
