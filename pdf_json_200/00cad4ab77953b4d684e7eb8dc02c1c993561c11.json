            "text": "Locally advanced cervical cancer occasionally induces pyometra, but there have been no reports of meningitis where pyometra is the cause of infection. Here, we report a case of Listeria monocytogenes meningitis related to pyometra during concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in a cervical cancer patient. The patient, a 77-year-old woman, was diagnosed with Stage IIB (FIGO 2018) cervical adenocarcinoma, and CCRT was initiated. Pyometra was exacerbated during CCRT, and after her first brachytherapy, she presented at our hospital with fever and decreased consciousness level. After admission to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient lost consciousness and experienced frequent seizures; tracheal intubation was required. Whole-body computed tomography revealed pyometra; therefore, transvaginal removal of the abscess was performed. Laboratory tests and vital signs indicated septic shock, and meropenem was administered. L. monocytogenes was detected in the abscess from the uterine cavity and the blood cultures on the third day of hospitalization. A lumbar puncture was performed on the same day to investigate whether the patient had meningitis. A FilmArray meningitis/encephalitis panel test of the spinal fluid revealed L. monocytogenes. After the diagnosis of meningitis with L. monocytogenes, ampicillin and gentamicin were started, and the blood test results gradually improved. Five months after the initial episode, her consciousness recovered, however she still received mechanical ventilatory support. L. monocytogenes infections can occur in patients undergoing chemotherapy, even without the use of steroids or immunosuppressive agents. In cases with pyometra, intrauterine manipulation can increase the risk of severe infection.",

Pyometra is caused by cervical cancer, cervicitis, and aging. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for cervical cancer can also cause pyometra (Imachi et al., 1993) . The main pathogenic bacteria in pyometra are Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis (Yildizhan et al., 2006) , and the symptoms include abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, and irregular genital bleeding. More than half of the cases of pyometra are asymptomatic (Imachi et al., 1993) ; however asymptomatic pyometra can cause uterine perforation, which can lead to serious peritonitis or septic shock (Imachi et al., 1993; Yildizhan et al., 2006) .",

Ampil et al. reported only one patient who developed pyometra after radiotherapy with brachytherapy among 12 cervical cancer patients with hydrometra before treatment (Ampil and Bell, 1997) . According to the report, the incidence rate of pyometra is small. However, in our case, MRI during CCRT showed increased fluid accumulation in the uterine cavity, suggesting that fluid accumulation developed secondary to treatment. The patient had sepsis and meningitis related to the pyometra, partly owing to immunocompromise caused by CCRT. There are several reports of pyometra developing to sepsis, mainly owing to induced uterine perforation and peritonitis (Imachi et al., 1993; Yildizhan et al., 2006) . In such cases, abdominal pain is one of the chief complaints (Yildizhan et al., 2006) . However, our patient had no complaint of abdominal pain at the outpatient clinic the day before the consciousness deterioration, and no intra-abdominal free space was identified on CT performed at hospital admission. Therefore, it is unlikely that the sepsis was induced by uterine perforation. In this case, grade 2 leukopenia, grade 3 neutropenia, and grade 4 lymphopenia were observed before the administration of CCRT, suggesting that manipulation of the uterine cavity during brachytherapy under an immunosuppressive situation may have been the main cause. CCRT with brachytherapy has been reported to cause grade \u2265 3 leukopenia in approximately 7.5% of cases (Jakubowicz et al., 2014) , and some cases, like our patient, experienced a high risk of infection. This suggests that pyometra should be eliminated when invasive procedures are performed in such cases. (Drevets and Bronze, 2008) ; however, intrauterine infection in post-menopausal patients following CCRT has never been reported. L. monocytogenes usually enters human hosts via the gastrointestinal tract after ingesting contaminated food (Drevets and Bronze, 2008) . The bacterial culture of the vaginal discharge from our patient did not prove L. monocytogenes; thus, there is a possibility that pyometra developed hematogenously rather than via an ascending route, as with other causative agents, such as Enterobacterales. L. monocytogenes can be internalized in both phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells (Radoshevich and Cossart, 2018) , avert host immune systems, and be transported to an infected organ inside infected monocytes (Drevets and Bronze, 2008) . Therefore, the presence of a lesion in the uterus that could have been infiltrated by monocytes may have been a predisposing factor in this patient. During the brachytherapy, the applicators were inserted into the uterine cavity in the presence of pyometra, and this procedure might have triggered eventual bacterial spread.",
