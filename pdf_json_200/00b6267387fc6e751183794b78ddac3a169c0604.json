            "text": "Dear Editor, Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading infectious cause of morbidity worldwide, particularly among children in developing countries (Mortality and Causes of Death 2016). With the introduction of rotavirus vaccines, noroviruses have been identified as a leading cause of AGE outbreaks and sporadic disease worldwide (Hall et al. 2013) . The norovirus genome contains three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes the nonstructural viral proteins including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF2 and ORF3 encode the respective major (VP1) and minor (VP2) structural proteins. Based on phylogenetic clustering of the complete VP1 amino acid sequence, norovirus can be divided into 10 genogroups (G) ) of which GI, GII, and GIV have been found among human beings. Genogroups can be subdivided into 9 GI, 27 GII, and 2 GIV genotypes . A dual-nomenclature system has been proposed for GI and GII noroviruses using partial regions of the ORF1 RNA polymerase (P)-encoding region and partial region of ORF2.",

            "text": "Since the mid-1990s, genogroup II genotype 4 (GII.4) noroviruses have caused the majority of outbreaks and sporadic cases worldwide. Recombination which often occurs at the ORF1/ORF2 junction and antigenic drift are the mechanism of evolution for norovirus. New GII.4 variants emerged with 2-3-year periodicity up to 2012. Afterwards, the GII.4 Sydney capsid seems to persist through recombination, with a novel recombinant of GII. From November 2018 to September 2020, a prospective study about viral etiology of AGE in pediatric outpatients was conducted in Beijing Children's Hospital. AGE was defined as [ 3 events involving loose feces, vomiting, or both within a 24-h period. A total of 605 patients each one with a fecal sample were enrolled into this study. Among them, 64% were male, 36% were female. The sex ratio (male/female) was 1.78:1. The age of patients ranged from one month to 16.0 years (median, 1.0 year). About 64.1% (388/605) cases were infants less than 1 year old. Viral RNA was extracted from 10% fecal suspension (mixing 0.1 g feces with 1.0 mL phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2)). Then a commercial kit of multiplex real-time PCR for norovirus (GI and GII) and rotavirus (group A) (Shuoshi, Jiangsu, China) was used in this study. The positive samples of norovirus were amplified by conventional RT-PCR with SuperScript TM III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum TM Taq DNA Polymerase kit (Invitrogen). Dual-typing system of norovirus was used in this study, which amplifies a partial region of ORF1 and a partial region of ORF2 (van Beek et al. 2018) . The previously published oligonucleotide primers for GII viruses were MON431 (TGGACIAGRGGICCYAAYCA) and G2SKR (CCRCCNGCATRHCCRTTRTACAT). The expected PCR product size is 570 bp (Cannon et al. 2017 (Cannon et al. , 2019 . All PCR products were subjected to Sanger sequencing and genotypes were assigned using the Norovirus Genotyping tool (http:// www.rivm.nl/mpf/norovirus/typingtool). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method implemented in MEGA software (version 5.01) with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The sequences of the noroviruses identified in this study were deposited in GenBank (GenBank accession numbers: MW205541-MW205668).",

The positive rate of norovirus was 34.3% in 0-1 year age group, followed by 27.0% and 20.9% in 2-5 years age group and 6-18 years age group, respectively. There were significant differences in the positive rate of norovirus between different age groups (P = 0.026). Young children are the risk groups of norovirus infection. As in this study, the detection rate of norovirus in young children is relatively high, especially in children under 1 year old.",

In this study, the most prevalent norovirus was recombinant GII.4[P31] genotype in sporadic AGE children. It is similar to the study of sporadic cases in Shanghai from 2014 to 2018, in which the predominant genotype was GII.4 Sydney[P31] (Wang et al. 2019). However, it is different with norovirus outbreaks studies in the past 5 years. In China, the predominant genotype of norovirus outbreaks were GII.17[P17] and GII.2[P16] in 2014-2015 and 2016-2018, respectively (Ao et al. 2017; Gao et al. 2019; Jin et al. 2020). In this study, the most prevalent genotype was recombinant GII.4[P31]. It is reported that over the past 10 years, GII.4 Sydney[P31] and GII.4 Sydney[P16] were the predominant strain epidemic globally (van Beek et al. 2018). GII.4 Sydney[P31] has been the predominant strain in Canada (Hasing et al. 2019) and Thailand (Chuchaona et al. 2019) since 2012. And GII.4 Sydney[P16] has been popular in Germany, Netherlands, America, Japan and Canada since 2014",
